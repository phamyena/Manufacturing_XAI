"tl;dr:  d-pad lacks precision.

look, this controller is a cut above most.  everything feels good and it is quality for the price paid for it.  the issue is that the d-pad lacks precision needed for games like street fighter ii on snes.  the funny thing is that i can throw a dragon punch with the left side of the pad, but not with the right.  i can throw a fireball on the right, but not the left.  maybe others have had better success with theirs, but right now it doesn't feel up to par for me.

"this is a skillfully delivered academic lecture by an extremely educated woman that has a deep love and obvious respect for the tanakh. she conveys the information as it stands. if there is no historical or archaeological evidence to prove that the people within the writings existed- she will tell you so. and she will tell you the genius that scholars see within the stories.

i know that amy-jill levine is an orthodox jew. however- it is clear that she does not have to flaunt her own beliefs or twist the research of scholars. she does not push her own religious faith, but provides a very analytical approach where she shows full respect for the political climate that the authors endured at the time of the writings, their influences, the parallel stories that they would have known in their lives, their culture, and their writing styles.

one thing that was very poignant to me was how dr. levine points out the richness of  disciplines that are offered by studying the old testament: history, geography, literature, linguistics, social sciences, economics, historical law, historical art, humanities, philosophy- it is all there. if you have never seen someone that has the enthusiastic desire, the educational background, and the insight to teach this subject with respect to the many and varied aspects of the old testament- then you owe it to yourself to listen.

if you are not a student, or if you forgot your literature courses, or if you are a bit insecure about your own religious beliefs- then you may be put off by academic terms that are used in this lecture. the professor respects you as an adult and treats you as such. so she does not curtail the appropriate use of terms like ""myth""- which is a *symbolic narrative* or a story to that provides an *explanation* for something, and it is a known style of writing that was common in antiquity.
here is an anthropological truth: in calling a story a myth we are expressing no opinion about whether it is true or not. this is the difference between common speech and academic speech. the word ""theory"" has suffered similar misunderstandings. for those that still don't understand, here's another fun fact to to ponder: an ""apocalypse"" is also a style of writing. and there's more than one apocalypse in the bible.

if you are fascinated with the layers of history and the labyrinth of discoveries that can be found in our world's ancient writings- you will love this. if you are secular- you will enjoy the refreshing analytical approach to a subject that so often comes with a show-business-like presentation.
if you are religious and confident in your faith- then you should enjoy knowing the complexities on how such an influential and revered work came to be. but if you are religious and easily threatened by evidence and research, then you might not enjoy this so much.

my favorite aspect of this lecture series is that dr. levine gives you glimpses to hundreds of different directions that you can take in your own studies. she could mention a word or two that reminds you to explore a subject- and then you will end up opening a door to yet another rich world of research. it is a lot of information. i know i will be listening over and over to take it all in.",0,software,skillfully deliver academic lecture extremely educate woman deep love obvious respect tanakh conveys information stand historical archaeological evidence prove people within writing exist tell tell genius scholar see within story know amyjill levine orthodox jew however clear flaunt belief twist research scholar push religious faith provide analytical approach show full respect political climate author endure time writing influence parallel story would know life culture write style one thing poignant dr levine point richness discipline offer study old testament history geography literature linguistics social science economics historical law historical art humanity philosophy never see someone enthusiastic desire educational background insight teach subject respect many varied aspect old testament owe listen student forget literature course bite insecure religious belief may put academic term use lecture professor respect adult treat curtail appropriate use term like myth * symbolic narrative * story provide * explanation * something know style write common antiquity anthropological truth call story myth express opinion whether true difference common speech academic speech word theory suffer similar misunderstanding still understand another fun fact ponder apocalypse also style write one apocalypse bible fascinate layer history labyrinth discovery find world ancient writing love secular enjoy refresh analytical approach subject often come showbusinesslike presentation religious confident faith enjoy know complexity influential revered work come religious easily threaten evidence research might enjoy much favorite aspect lecture series dr levine give glimpse hundred different direction take study could mention word two remind explore subject end opening door yet another rich world research lot information know listen take

it's okay at best. mine came in with a few keys with smuged paint (most noticable is the enter key) but so far function right. my only true issue is the props in the back do very little to raise the keyboard up at an angle. i'm having to put rubber spacers under it to get the angle i prefer. the keys themselves are pretty quiet which it pretty nice. the colors for the backlights aren't as vibrant as the picture suggests however. they seem sorta faded. the mouse is modeled directly after the reddragon m601 it seems. it functions the same and feels sorta the same. just missing the weight adjustments in the bottom. instead of a weight section you get a batman logo. cool i guess? the clickers are less stiff and are a bit flemzy but overall okay. the blue of the mouse is rather blinding though. it is really bright.,1,game,okay best mine come key smuged paint noticable enter key far function right true issue prop back little raise keyboard angle put rubber spacers get angle prefer key pretty quiet pretty nice color backlights vibrant picture suggest however seem sorta fade mouse model directly reddragon m601 seem function feel sorta miss weight adjustment bottom instead weight section get batman logo cool guess clickers less stiff bit flemzy overall okay blue mouse rather blind though really bright

"i used to use turbo tax every year.  about three years ago i decided i'd try tt, taxcut by h&r block and taxact.  all three were the web versions and charged nothing until you filed.  i found that both taxcut and taxact arrived at the same result, which was in my favor by $30.  i couldn't figure out why tt was different.  also, tt cost about three times what taxact did.  all three were easy to use, taxact being the most clear in my opinion, however taxact imported less from brokerages.

so, for three years i used taxact paying about $18 total a year for federal and state with efiles.

in 2013 i donated some appreciated mutual funds so i figured i'd need the advertised cost basis tracking and other items listed as a tt advantage.  well, i purchased tt for $50 here on amazon, loaded it (forgot how much i dislike loading software after using the web versions, all the updating etc).  the result was quite disappointing, it did not help me to track my cost basis like i thought it would (tell us which share you purchased and when, and it would look them up and track) it actually had me look up all the info and enter it.  that is exactly how the other two software would have handled it, and for a lot less money with a lot less annoying menus and updates.

"purchased this in high school way back in '99 and in all these years till now,  i have been using this on and off while accumulating many other resources for learning french. i too travel to france often and its 2016 now! i am certainly a francophile and my french accent has always been appreciated in paris. regarding fluency,  that is totally dependent on your hard work.  i would highly recommend  this to new learners. regarding installation,  windows xp works just fine,  and you can use vmware or parallels on macosx. the workbook is engaging and provides a good form of redundancy and a recapitulation resource when the cds are not constantly used. i liked the grammer glossary and the grammer section in general. the cd instruction is well done and the pictures and lessons are well paced,  many phrases are immediately referenced in memory even after all these years just cos they were so entertaining. the accent meter really does work well.

most people who have issues with yhe system are jusy average users using the then windows systems which are archaic and buggy by todays standards. the company is kindof changed or merged with another,  but this package is self contained so hardly requires any net connection. seems to be a one of project by the development team but you can tell it was done  very well.

rosetta stone and duolingo are awesome and more contemporary apps that provide many benefits,  but for an engaging and quite thorough introduction to french conversation and grammer,  this package has its own stance,  and holds up very well.  rosetta stone kind of takes too much visual time and seems slow too. duolingo hits a sweet spot in giving targeted lessons while engaging the etudiant in  writing  exercises regularly.

while conversational skills can certainly be gained by listening alone,  true fluency can only be accomplished by writing and creating text that involves analytical skills and good grasp of grammer and language conventions.

"first off, i've played mlb the show since the beginning, and before that it was mlb 2k, world series baseball, vr baseball, batter up, bases loaded and yes even major league baseball featuring ken griffey jr.  since i can remember sports video games have been just about the only games that have mattered and i grew up during the growth of the video game (29 now).

so to hear people bash mlb 2013 the show for slight improvements, or similarities to last year's game is beyond me.  when i sit back and look at the big picture of where sports games have been and what they are now, it's incredible.  even in the last five years it's a crazy positive difference.

anyhow, this year's game is very similar to lasts, i haven't gone out and read any reviews so these are just my thoughts upon playing a few games today.  i will update as i see fit as i play more.  the changes are subtle, just like the game of baseball.  the game though is still fantastic.

also i typically play against the computer, on legend, in franchise mode.  i want the most simulation type experience possible.  so i turn off the strike zone and most feedback except for pitch speed.  i also make everything as manual as possible.

the first thing i noticed with this year's game is the change from a circular batting curser to a more oval two hash marks type shape.  of course you can change this in the options but i think it is more correct to actual baseball.  the bats sweet spot is longer than it is tall so it should be like this, not a circle.  we still have the same power/regular/contact swing options too, which i like.

the biggest difference in hitting it seems is that the ""window"" for the batter to hit the ball is far different, and easier i might add.  on legend mode there were numerous times against cc sabathia that i thought i was late and struck out when my batter would either foul the ball off or put it in play.  so batting is easier on all levels it seems because of this.  which is fine, as i would almost always lead the league in k's.  this also has created some slightly weird placements of the ball off the bat though, as my hitter will pull the ball when sometimes i feel like i've obviously been fooled.  ball mechanics are still excellent though, and it's not like i'm hitting the ball out of the park like in an arcade game etc.

as far as pitcher batter battles these are all very similar to last year's game and excellent.  ichiro sucks to pitch to, gives long at bats, and johnny gomes is mr. all or nothing.  i can't believe how realistic the pitch counts and batter pitcher match ups are to real life.  the box scores at the end of the game look very accurate and i love that.  stats are a part of baseball and mlb gets it right most of the time.

pitching is pretty much the same with the same options and controls.  the difference though is that the ball paths seem to be a little smoothed out and more realistic.  a sinker is a little less sharp at the end, the curve balls arch a little more and fast balls have a better simulation of ""late life.""  it's great.

fielding at first seems too similar to lasts years game as a lot of the motions of the fielders are identical.  i wish they had updated player movements a little more.  i'm fine with a lot of the gameplay stuff but the visuals and motion for the players is what really makes it feel like you are playing something ""new."" at first i thought it was identical to last years game but after more extensive gameplay there are many small changes that give the fielders a different feel. while it may have felt like more of a new game if they had altered and added more motions, they certainly did pay attention to this area.  it can be noticed mostly when players dive or jump after a ball.  in the past they used to ""lunge"" at alien like speed to catch a ball when now the motion is much more human and they really have to ""make the play"" or get to the ball.  there are also other intricate things added to fielding, but don't expect an overhaul.

batting stances and pitching wind-ups are as good as ever and each player's general motions fit each particular player fairly well.  so when cc winds up and throws he feels and looks like the big old lug that he is.

as usual mlb has provided a fairly accurate game that feels like baseball, real sim ballgames.  which is what i want.  this year's version may not blow you away with new features and visuals, but it was already a great game and it still is.

more updates to come later on.

---------------

after a couple more games it's even more evident how the subtleties of ball mechanics have improved in each aspect of the game.  players react differently to hard hit balls and soft hit balls.  batters can ""carve"" the ball better based on their swings, the arch of batted balls is more realistic than last years game and balls skid along the ground in a more fluid manner which is more realistic.  it takes a while of play to really notice this but it's in how the ball will deflect off a fielder when short hopped or in how the ball caroms on a 55 foot curve-ball.  they did some nice work here.

other than that another nice option is more pitching and hitting views.  i usually keep the default view for hitting, but i always pitch from behind the pitcher in some fashion usually with ""outfield"" view.  it looks like baseball on tv and i think gives a better approximation of what it is like to pitch rather then being from the pov of the catcher.

---------------

amazon user ""a phillips"" wrote this in the comments section and i believe it's very important to understanding this years game and the improvements over previous versions, so i will quote him and add thoughts:

""...last night 3 things happened, that i can remember. one i hit a ball to the 2b and picked it up dropped it and picked it back up. another ball i hit to youklis was lined to 3b very hard defensive play,it bounced off his glove and i was safe at 1b. the day before, rafael furcal hit a hr , morse tried to snag and rob it it hit of his glove and bounced into the spring training crowd. i have all of these on video by the way. i have a litany of video i could show you the addressd my correction of the smoothness of defensive gameplay.

by the same token, morse made a breathtaking diving catch that was not at all video gameish, its what you'd expect to see in a major league ball game. addressing defensive gameplay and its smoothness and all around gameplay is something must be done to unlock the capabilities of this game...""

the point here being, that the more you play, the more subtle improvements you'll notice as to realistic events occurring as they would in an actual ballgame.  great baseball analyst tim kurkjian is somewhat famous for saying the the most fascinating thing about baseball is that on any given day at the park, you can see something that has never happened before, whether it be a minor statistical occurrence, or a major feat like a perfect game.  you truly do get many of the ""small"" parts of baseball in mlb the show and it can't be overlooked.  i remember in past years being frustrated that fielders would never throw short hops to the first baseman.  then they added in short hops but the way the first basemen handled them was unrealistic.  now as mentioned above, in this years game the reaction and plays the fielders make based on what the ball is doing is quite exceptional.  and aside from the similar motions that the players do, the actual result and movement of them is definitely refined in this years game.

a phillips also wrote:

""'out of the box' this game needs alot of adjustment, or a little if you know what you're doing, to unlock the full potential of this game. maybe google this and it will help. madman sliders""

this is also an important note.  this game needs adjustment through the gameplay settings and sliders to play optimally and most importantly how you want it to play.  it indeed as refined a game as actual major league baseball.  a true simulation.  so some research on sliders or experimenting on your own will be necessary with this game.

"it is a rare event indeed when i manage to play halfway through a game (20+ hrs) and then have to quit because of the overpowering desire to destroy my ps2, the controller, and my entire living room furniture setup out of sheer rage and frustration. i say rare, because most trash games are lucky to get a few hours out of me before they get flushed down the toilet. i'll admit, reluctantly, that i tolerated the first part of the game. so when did the honeymoon end? wow, where do i begin?

-story. to put it simply: it's dull. aside from the initial medieval planet you start on, the rest of game failed to provide any form of intriguing plot. once the giant spaceship of doom appeared and starting blasting things with laser beams, i yawned and lost interest. most of the story is cliched, and that which is not tailors mostly to the star trek crowd (of which i am not a fan).

-characters. the characters you control are lame and annoying, with fayt being the worst offender by far. ""gee cliff, i don't see why we can't just give that big dragon a big sloppy kiss and huggity hug so that we can all just live in glorious peace and harmony. do we have to kill it?"" never mind the fact that you just polished off 5,000 of his brothers and sisters in that cave you just trekked through, fayt you moron. the other characters aren't as bad personality-wise, but they're just as verbose. yada yada yada. be quiet.

-dialogue. mind-numbing. like someone else said in their review, most of this game is dialogue and cut-scenes. you know, if a company is going to make this much of a game dialogue, then why not make it any good? god, i just wanted the characters to shut up already and go eat an blueberry or something. you're not philosophers, you're monster hitmen. go do your job. suffice it to say, this part of the game probably accounted for 15 of the 25 hrs i put into the game before ending the trauma altogether. too much talking about a boring story and not enough action.

-battles. by far, the most irritating part of this game. granted, it was unique for a few hours, but it quickly got old and stale. why? for several reasons. 1) enemy difficult is woefully inconsistent. you'll be blazing through one dungeon, killing enemies in 3-4 hits, and then in the very next dungeon, enemies take 50 hits before they die. i remember spending 2 hours in one area, raising mad levels with my triple exp bonus gauge activated, only to walk into the next dungeon and have the first group of enemies use me for toilet paper! wtf?! bosses are the same way: ridiculously easy in one battle, and near impossible in the next (without at least 10 attempts). 2)enemies use a paralysis counteract if you hit them when their fury is full. this wouldn't be a problem if enemy fury actually dropped when they attacked like your players' do. i'll be lucky to get in one hit before clang now you're paralyzed. the enemy would usually follow up with a hit that took 100 hp off my my 2500 hp total, and my bonus gauge would break, citing a critical hit. yeah, that's a critical percentage. fun. 3)gone are the days when just losing all your hp would kill you, now you have to friggin' worry about your mp too! if it hits 0, you die! hooray! my favorite part was in one cave where this one enemy used some vortex blade attack and killed off two of my high-level characters immediately (each had 3000+ hp full up), mainly because the attack removed mp rather than hp. screw you. 4) enemy ai is cheap and stupid. they simply use the same powerful attacks over and over again. same goes for the lame bosses. your characters are wailing away on some boss, lost in some 30 hit combo, when all of a sudden ""fire breath"" happens and all your characters and blown across the screen, with half their health gone, nearly dead from mp loss, and no fury. probably confused or poisoned too. rinse and repeat, and you have the general battle experience provided by this game.

-exploring/treasure. i remember in the good ol' days when exploring was productive and finding treasure chests was actually *gasp* enjoyable! why? because actual treasure was found. i think out of the 1,000 chests i managed to open before quitting, 950 of them contained some form of freakin' berry (used for healing purposes). completely sucked the fun out of exploring. why can't you give me more weapons!?!

-items. yay, i can only carry 20 of each. umm why, considering i use 5 of them after every battle. nice.

-inventing. so dumb. just how complicated must you make this process? it would be nice to have potential inventors clue you in as to which item they are looking for and where they are, rathing than spewing some more so3 plot-garbage that means nothing anyway. hooray, cynthia is available to recruit! so where is she, and what do i need to do to get her? who knows, no one is going to tell you! why not even a little hint?? oh i get it, ""difficulty"". right.

-hidden things. this reminds me of the more recent final fantasy games. you have to complete 10 off the wall, ridiculously hard tasks just to get one weapon, or one inventor. sure, i'll win a bunny race 100 times in a row to get this one inventor. why on earth would you want to do that? how on earth would you even know to do that in the first place? it's like they want you to purchase a strat guide with the game. thieves.

-battle trophies. stupid and not worth collecting, seeing how most of them are earned from completing mindless and outrageous tasks such as ""win 5,000,000,000 battles"" or ""win 3,000,000 battles without getting hit"", and when you do collect enough of them, the rewards are poor. costumes for a battle mini-game. yawn. new difficulty level. oh wait, do i get to play the game on a new, harder difficulty level? oh boy another 40 hrs of absolute frustration and poor design awaits.

-puzzles. i just love trial and error puzzles. it's a good thing too, since this game is full of them. sigh. this category also needs to include the ""where do i go next"" puzzle, where during a cutscene, a character will mention off-hand where you need to go next, and i'll miss it because i sneezed or something, and then i'll have absolutely no idea where to go. and townspeople won't even help me! wtf? how about a world map that indicates your next location or goal. novel!

i remember 10 years ago when games used to be fun, and not a chore. you know, you can still have difficulty in a video game without making the player suffer through some overly complicated battle system, fighting enemies for hours on end because the stupid things won't die. if only the developers would take a little time to adjust the flow of the game-- start off easy and progressively get more difficult, but never too difficult as long as you're leveling at a reasonable rate. i want my games to move at a brisk pace, only slowing down when i choose to level or complete a sidequest. don't make me spend 5 hours fighting enemies to gain enough experience to raise another two levels so that maybe one of my characters can survive a boss battle. is that too much to ask?

my initial impressions were very favourable. my pc started up much faster, shut down faster, and generally didn't seem to be labouring under such a heavy load as with norton.  i was delighted.

then i tried to get my home network to connect to the internet, and the nightmare started. nothing seemed to work.  this surprised me, because norton just handled the whole thing transparently with no effort from me.

worse, when i visited the zone labs community discussion forum, the same topic came up with shocking regularity ""cannot get home network to connect to internet.""

oh dear.

eventually i found out that it can be made to work (you have to delve around in the innards of windows, get dns settings, and enter them manually into zone alarm).  ok, i'm a pc dunce. i don't even know what dns settings are, but i assumed that once i'd gone through this procedure once, i could forget all about it again.

not so... it seems that dns settings change occasionally.  so you need to go through the whole rigmarole on a regular basis.

"we spent two weeks driving and sightseeing in italy. be aware that the maps on this microsd are not the very latest from garmin. we asked the amazon seller about the version and were informed 2013.xx and received version 2013.10, while the latest is 2013.30. for half the cost of garmin's latest we felt that the slightly older version would be okay and it was. the product contained all the roads we needed from la spezia to martina franca to amalfi.
we were generally happy with the routing between cities and in newer cities. in older cities with narrow streets and tall buildings the gps had difficulty finding our location.
there was a significant error in the maps traveling east of caserta. the gps was sure we were not on the road we actually were on and could not route us to our next destination. the other general routing problem was garmin thinks some roads are 90 kph roads but were actually 50 kph. instead of sending us the fastest route we ended up on small poorly maintained back roads.

"this was completely over hyped, so i'm going to grade it based on what the publisher told us it would be, because i think they deserve that. my review is basically going to be a bunch of loosely related comments:

it feels unfinished in almost every important way: the levels, the graphics, the animations, the objectives, the abilities, the balance, the story, even the goddamn server browser (it's pathetic how sloppy that server browser is). the weapons are all so closely related, most of them are useless stat variations of eachother that you'll use twice then you'll go back to the better ones. it's like a mix of tf2 and call of duty but in the worst way possible. they tried to take the teamplay from tf2 and the gunplay of call of duty but it came out a less fun version of call of duty. tf2 succeeded with its gameplay style because there are almost no ""point and click and kill"" weapons like in cod. that allowed the mobility of each class to play a significant role, while keeping it balanced and keeping the skill ceiling very high. cod is basically about being in the right place at the right times and having good aim. brink futilely tries to mix both. it tries to let you run around like a slow scout in tf2, but when all the enemy has to do to kill you is point at you and click, there's no point in jumping around like an idiot, it just makes you more vulnerable. even if it was useful, the maps in brink don't offer enough opportunity to use the ""smart"" movement anyway. i had high hopes for the character customization, but to be honest it's useless and i think they should have spent time on actual gameplay instead. there is no kill cam shot and your teammates/enemies both have thick blue/red outlines and shading, so you'll never get to appreciate the customization. the a.i. is really really bad too, and it's disgustingly prominent in the single player ""campaign"" (it's not a campaign at all, it's a series of offline matches with bots, seriously, it's sad).

i know i sound bitter but i was really disappointed in this game. it's the first non-blizzard game i've ever preordered because it looked like it would be such a great game, but it's a total failure. if you had no expectations and you've never played tf2 or cod, you would maybe like this game, but you would still be wasting your money. i gave this 1 star, partly because it is simply a low quality game, and partly because i think the publisher deserves the lowest possible score for selling an unfinished, rusty game at full price.",2,game,completely hype go grade base publisher tell u would think deserve review basically go bunch loosely related comment feel unfinished almost every important way level graphics animation objective ability balance story even goddamn server browser pathetic sloppy server browser weapon closely related useless stat variation eachother use twice go back well one like mix tf2 call duty bad way possible tried take teamplay tf2 gunplay call duty come less fun version call duty tf2 succeed gameplay style almost point click kill weapon like cod allow mobility class play significant role keep balance keep skill ceiling high cod basically right place right times good aim brink futilely try mix try let run around like slow scout tf2 enemy kill point click point jump around like idiot make vulnerable even useful map brink offer enough opportunity use smart movement anyway high hope character custom honest useless think spent time actual gameplay instead kill cam shot teammatesenemies thick bluer outline shade never get appreciate custom ai really really bad disgustingly prominent single player campaign campaign series offline match bots seriously sad know sound bitter really disappointed game first nonblizzard game ever preordered look like would great game total failure expectation never play tf2 cod would maybe like game would still waste money give 1 star partly simply low quality game partly think publisher deserves lowest possible score selling unfinished rusty game full price

"i have been using ms office products since the early 90s.  i have always loved using ms office and cannot imagine life without it.  as a teacher i rely heavily on word, powerpoint, and excel, especially.

the computers at school have office 2010 on them, and i love all of the newer features.  in particular, the ability to insert videos into powerpoint presentations is especially usefully to me as a social studies teacher.  unfortunately, my school only has the license to provide us with a copy of office 2003 to install on our personal computers for home use.  since i love all of the newer features, i decided to buy and install the latest version of ms office on my personal laptop.  big mistake.

i bought the office home and student version, not office 365.  yes, i got all of the great new features, but all of those benefits are cancelled out by the one main drawback of the new version--the inability to work offline.  yes, that's right--you cannot use this version of office unless you are connected to the internet.  so when i'm at work and cannot connect my personal laptop to the internet, office is totally useless to me.  or, if i am travelling or away from my house, i'm out of luck.  i cannot believe microsoft thought this was a good idea.  i have read many complaints on line and confirmed this is a widespread issue.  like many people, i believe this is a digital rights/copy protection scheme, and i don't buy microsoft's denial.

the inability to use this program without an internet connection is a huge problem for me.  often, i would like to open and run a powerpoint from my laptop at work, but i can't.  even worse, if i am trying to get work done at home and the internet is down for some reason, i am out of luck.

another super-annoying problem caused by the inability to work off-line is that i will be working on something and then the program stops working and tells me ""office may appear unresponsive"" because it is streaming necessary files.  this happens every time i am using ms office.  it will start working again after some time, but i often lose my train of thought or get distracted by something else during this time.  it is crazy that i have to deal with an issue like this on a program i paid a whole lot of money for.

as a result of these drawbacks of office 2013, i am only giving this product two stars.  if i could work off line and didn't have to wait for files to stream all the time, i would have given this product five stars.  i strongly encourage people to buy or stick with an older version of office.  i will definitely not buy a newer version of office until this issue is fixed.  i cannot say enough how much i have always loved office and how many hours i have used word, outlook, excel, and powerpoint.  it really makes me sad and disappointed to think i will either have to stick with an old program or find an different one to use.  i am to the point where i am going to install office 2003 and use that one instead.  my only hope is that microsoft will wake up and look at all of the complaints on the internet and come out with an update that allows their loyal customers to use the product we paid for when and where we want.

and to save microsoft from posting a useless reply to this message, i have their forums and even posted a question about this problem.  predictably, my question got no response.  here's that thread:

[...]

i just tried again to open word while wifi is off and my laptop is in airplane mode, and a dialog box pops up with this message:

""background installation ran into a problem.
please make sure you're still connected to the internet, or try connecting to a different network.
we'll automatically resume installation as soon as possible, and you can keep working once we do.""

microsoft's answer in the forum was that once all files are installed, we should be able to work while in airplane mode, but this is not true.  i have had this program on my computer since february, i have used it for many hours, and this still happens 100% of the time.  i also saw a moderator on the forum as why we would want to work offline, which is an outlandish question to ask.  i explained why above.  sometimes we don't have a choice.

like i said, my hope here is not to get a refund, but that microsoft will come to its senses and not drive off countless loyal customers by adding pointless, dumb features to ms office.",2,software,use ms office product since early 90 always love use ms office imagine life without teacher rely heavily word powerpoint excel especially computer school office 2010 love newer feature particular ability insert video powerpoint presentation especially usefully social study teacher unfortunately school license provide u copy office 2003 install personal computer home use since love newer feature decide buy install late version m office personal laptop big mistake buy office home student version office 365 yes get great new feature benefit cancel one main drawback new versionthe inability work offline yes rightyou use version office unless connect internet work connect personal laptop internet office totally useless travel away house luck believe microsoft think good idea read many complaint line confirm widespread issue like many people believe digital rightscopy protection scheme buy microsoft denial inability use program without internet connection huge problem often would like open run powerpoint laptop work even worse try get work do home internet reason luck another superannoying problem cause inability work offline work something program stop work tell office may appear unresponsive stream necessary file happen every time use ms office start work time often lose train think get distract something els time crazy deal issue like program pay whole lot money result drawback office 2013 give product two star could work line wait file stream time would give product five star strongly encourage people buy stick old version office definitely buy new version office issue fix say enough much always love office many hour use word outlook excel powerpoint really make sad disappointed think either stick old program find different one use point go install office 2003 use one instead hope microsoft wake look complaint internet come update allows loyal customer use product pay want save microsoft post useless reply message forums even post question problem predictably question get response threatongue_sticking_out_cheeky_playful_or_blowing_a_raspberry try open word wifi laptop airplane mode dialog box pop message background installation run problem please make sure still connect internet try connect different network automatically resume installation soon possible keep work microsoft answer forum file instal able work airplane mode true program computer since february use many hour still happen 100 % time also saw moderator forum would want work offline outlandish question ask explain sometimes choice like say hope get refund microsoft come sens drive countless loyal customer add pointless dumb feature ms office

"i played a lot of bf3 and despite the reviews, i picked this game up on black friday for $25.  first off, to all the people complaining about campaign, this isn't a single player game.  it has a single player option, but it's mostly for multiplayer.  anyways, i haven't noticed many of the problems most people have discussed.  one problem i have had it a freeze up of the game that requires a hard reset after about an hour or two of playing.  after the hard reset, another hour or so of gameplay, and it happens again. i've also noticed that quick match has a hard time connecting to servers, however, when i use server browser, i connect to any server that's not full.  filtering on the server browser is also broken, but it's easy to keep trying to join servers until i get in.  i expect all these issues resolved within a month.  none of these issues are upsetting enough to ragequit over.

they've tweaked the controls a lot, but after awhile, it does feel easier to control some vehicles.  the helicopter is the only vehicle  i switched to the controls back to the old style.

as for the game itself, graphics are worse than bf3.  it makes sense to me though since they made this for the ps4, and ported it down so other people would have the option to play it (plus make more money).  graphics aren't a really big deal to me though as long as the gameplay is good, and it is.  there's really nothing game breaking different from bf3 than bf4, but i still enjoy the game.  they added a few new vehicles that are a lot of fun to play with, maps are well designed, and despite so many people complaining about the game, there are still a ton of people playing it.

update: i dropped the rating on this game down a star.  since the game has come out (i guess about 2 months), there has only been one update for the ps3.  this helped resolve some of the issues, however, there are still plenty of game freezes.  how this solution hasn't been fixed over 2 months is beyond me.  i've also found another issue when i try to use a microphone for the game, my sound will make a constant humming, making sound basically useless.  the last update did fix quick match and filtering, it just seems minor to a problem that will damage ps3's with hard restarts.",1,game,play lot bf3 despite review pick game black friday $ 25 first people complain campaign single player game single player option mostly multiplayer anyways notice many problem people discuss one problem freeze game require hard reset hour two play hard reset another hour gameplay happen also notice quick match hard time connect server however use server browser connect server full filtering server browser also broken easy keep try join server get expect issue resolve within month none issue upset enough ragequit tweak control lot awhile feel easy control vehicle helicopter vehicle switch control back old style game graphic bad bf3 make sense though since make ps4 ported people would option play plus make money graphic really big deal though long gameplay good really nothing game break different bf3 bf4 still enjoy game added new vehicle lot fun play map well design despite many people complain game still ton people play update drop rating game star since game come guess 2 month one update ps3 help resolve issue however still plenty game freeze solution fix 2 month beyond also find another issue try use microphone game sound make constant humming making sound basically useless last update fix quick match filter seem minor problem damage ps3 hard restarts

"i've always had excellent software with creator but in november, 2013, after buying the latest version, all that changed. the part i was most interested in was backontrack. i wanted to be able to take full image backups and be able to restore them - sounds simple enough. two show stoppers with the software stopped me completely.  it just allows restore of individual files and folders, not the entire image. why would i want to take an image backup (includes everything) and then find out that this software will not restore the image. the whole purpose of image backups is to be able to restore the image in case of a totally screwed up hard drive (usually because of a disk failure).

to my surprise, when i tried to do even that, it would not allow even the backup to happen (wouldn't show a list of the images). i have spent hours going back and forth with support, sending whatever was asked for. i was then told i would have to sign up for expensive support (by then the purchase support had expired) but was assured that if it was found to be a product defect, i would be reimbursed. really? here i am on february 6, 2014 with no answer from support.

from the get-go, i could tell this headset was not as comfortable. it was too tight on the sides, especially since i wear glasses. the phones would push on my ear, which pushed on my frames, which caused me to constantly take the headset off. the second aggravating thing was the headband. it is not wide (like the ca), but thin, and the headset is fairly heavy. so the headband would start digging into the top of my head (if i wore it long enough after my ears were hurting).

besides comfort, we tested the mic. now, the ca had very good noise-canceling and would only pick up my voice. no background noise, not even a conference call that i had going over the computer's speakers for my husband to hear. the ca mic was awesome for my voice too - i don't like to speak very loudly, and even our panasonic 2-line cordless phones proved that callers had trouble hearing me. but the ca mic didn't have a problem, everyone i talked to mentioned how awesome i sounded.

but the logitech? didn't even come close. the mic picked up a lot, especially after i had to boost the decibels to try and get people to hear me better. my husband actually snapped his fingers on the other side of the room, and the mic picked it up!

"as the title says, i am very disappointed with amazon.com.  i routinely shop with confidence at amazon.com knowing that i can trust them to deliver what i order.  this was not the case with this purchase.

my daughter recently entered a post graduate editing program at uw and required microsoft word, so i bought her microsoft office home & student 2007 via amazon.com.  the product was advertised as a cd-rom version of the software, however, that is not what i received.  a few days later, i received a fedex envelope from ruckus enterprises.  the envelope contained a sheet of paper with download instructions for microsoft office and a 25-digit product code (license).  i was disappointed and confused about not receiving the packaged software, but time was of the essence and my daughter needed to edit papers in word.  so, i forwarded her the information and asked her to download, install, and activate the product according to the instructions on the sheet.

immediate;y there were problems with activation.  the product would not activate over the internet and she had to call microsoft directly.  the product would still not activate and she was allowed 15 uses of the product before it became permanently unusable.  to help her out, i made a housecall to see what i could do with the software.  i uninstalled and re-installed the software twice and attempted activation three times.  all attempts failed and then i noticed something odd--the product's title on hte header bar said, ""microsoft word non-cmmercial version.""  the microsft activation representative said that we may be victims of software piracy and the we should contact the vendor for resolution.  i could not find any contact information for ruckus enterprises, so i contacted amazon.com directly.

amazon was nice, but simply directed me to email ruckus enterprises and then wait up to three days for an answer.  it is now day two and no reply from ruckus enterprises.  i will give them one more day as instructed by amazon.com, but meanwhile my daughter cannot work and i am out nearly $100.  i was not aware of the vendor review section, but i wish that i was prior to purcahsing from amaon.com/ruckus enterprises.  ten out of ten reviews were negative and all mirrored my experience.  apparently ruckus enterprises does not have the software nor licenses and simply distributes hacked software and previously used licenses.

as i mentioned, i am very disappointed with amazon.com, mostly for allowing fraud by one of their vendors.  i am also disappointed that i did not receive the product as a packaged cd-rom as advertised.  i will thoroughly research each product and reviews before ever buying anything again on amazon.com, that is, if i ever buy from amazon.com again.",2,software,title say disappoint amazoncom routinely shop confidence amazoncom know trust deliver order case purchase daughter recently enter post graduate edit program uw require microsoft word buy microsoft office home & student 2007 via amazoncom product advertise cdrom version software however receive day later receive fedex envelope ruckus enterprises envelope contain sheet paper download instruction microsoft office 25digit product code license disappoint confused receive package software time essence daughter need edit paper word forward information ask download install activate product accord instruction sheet immediatey problem activation product would activate internet call microsoft directly product would still activate allow 15 us product become permanently unusable help make housecall see could software uninstalled reinstall software twice attempt activation three time attempt fail noticed something oddthe product title hte header bar say microsoft word noncmmercial version microsft activation representative say may victim software piracy contact vendor resolution could find contact information ruckus enterprise contact amazoncom directly amazon nice simply directed email ruckus enterprise wait three day answer day two reply ruckus enterprise give one day instruct amazoncom meanwhile daughter work nearly $ 100 aware vendor review section wish prior purcahsing amaoncomruckus enterprise ten ten review negative mirror experience apparently ruckus enterprise software license simply distribute hacked software previously use license mention disappointed amazoncom mostly allow fraud one vendor also disappointed receive product package cdrom advertise thoroughly research product review ever buy anything amazoncom ever buy amazoncom

"first of all let me just say i've only played about 4 hours into the story of this game. this review is only from the single player aspect of the game, and is not reflective of the multiplayer experience. after i finish the story and begin pvping, if i think the game is worth of additional stars i will update accordingly.

i am a huge fan of the entire battlefield series, and i've owned every single game, sometimes buying more than one copy to play on pc and ps3. i've bought copies for friends too. i was a premium member of both bf3 and bf4 on both platforms, so i think it's fair to say i am a well established fan.

this game misses the high standards set by previous games. there are several disappointing aspects of the game in some key areas, that the other games never had.
i'm half way through the story line and dissatisfied.

they kinda killed the whole point of the game, its a fps... without the shooting.

during the story, completing a perfect mission means never firing your gun. it is all too much like a simplified farcry 3 or 4. there is no large open roaming but there is a mission area with roaming guards that you are best to take out one by one by sneaking around and knocking them out or arresting them. it even has alarms that if activated bring in more enemies, but unlike farcry you cant simply use a suppressed rifle to snipe the alarm box, because the suppressor just seems to decrease your damage output, not allow silent kills. in fact using a sniper rifle, suppressed it takes more than one headshot to kill an enemy! so precision sniping is out, and it takes 3-4 body shots to kill as well. not very fun with a bolt action rifle and several enemies coming to kill you.

if you don't want to take the stealth tactic and you want to have a glorious gun battle, well it's extremely difficult to do because atleast on the hardest difficulty, it takes about 6 pistol or machine gun shots to bring down a bad guy. the higher power pistols (desert eagle, or large magnum) still take 2-3 shots per kill too. normally that would be fine, but you have a realistic amount of ammo, about 40-50 rounds  for your pistol. so that means you cant really fight more than 5 enemies at a time. the enemies move after you when gunshots ring out, so picking up additional ammo is fairly difficult or even impossible at some points.  yes you have a secondary weapon, and you might be able to use both to get those 5 guys down, but you are going to run out of ammo even more quickly with it.

there are many things in general game mechanics that have annoyed me as well, that i never saw in bf3 or 4.

for starters the story is terrible so far...it's just awful, too contrived and far fetched. i won't spoil it, just trust me it's awful.

realism is missing, in one point you perform a getaway, driving while your partner is shooting, which i thought could be fun at first but i was wrong. the enemies also shoot back at you and drive faster, a bad guy hanging out the window shooting while his car drives through barriers, trailors etc... the guy never so much as ducks in the car. then the car spins out hits a barrier and explodes...disappointing. also why is there so much crap on the highway anyway?

at a few points in the story, i've had no idea what to do next. this was the first thing that annoyed me. i am walking in the hood looking for some guy, and talking with my new partner then she just says ""i guess you know your way around here hu?"" and i respond something like ""not really i guess im a little rusty"" and my partner stops walking. that's it...what do i do? i haven't found a way to view the current mission objective. i didn't know what i was supposed to do, and my partner wouldn't budge. there is nothing on the mini map that even gives a clue. no periodic reminder of the objective either. just nothing. after i considered restarting this checkpoint because i thought it was a bug i eventually found oh, i just needed to explore, would've been nice to know what i needed to do.

at a separate point in the story i broke the mechanics a little on accident...you have to watch someone walk through a building and you must identify a certain person, well using my scanner i got ahead of the guy im supposed to watch and found the suspect long before my guy could get to him. me marking him was apparently some sort of marker, so he moved to a different room from where he was standing. well when my guy got to where the suspect was originally, he still had the conversation with the empty space. it was disappointing.

the graphics in general are pretty good on ps4, but nothing unexpected. when you do get into a shootout, shooting through obstacles is pretty neat. and the gunfire mechanics is really well done. the shotguns especially feel pretty powerful. but even in the graphics there are some noticeable bugs like during a couple cut scenes one or more character has 'seizure eyes'. their eyes move back and forth quickly at times.

it gets two stars because the gun fire and graphics, but loses 3 based on bugs, lacking general mechanics and terrible story.",2,game,first let say played 4 hour story game review single player aspect game reflective multiplayer experience finish story begin pvping think game worth additional star update accordingly huge fan entire battlefield series own every single game sometimes buy one copy play pc ps3 buy copy friend premium member bf3 bf4 platform think fair say well establish fan game miss high standard set previous game several disappointing aspect game key area game never half way story line dissatisfy kinda kill whole point game fps without shoot story complete perfect mission mean never fire gun much like simplify farcry 3 4 large open roam mission area roam guard best take one one sneaking around knock arrest even alarm activate bring enemy unlike farcry cant simply use suppressed rifle snipe alarm box suppressor seem decrease damage output allow silent kill fact use sniper rifle suppress take one headshot kill enemy precision snip take 34 body shot kill well fun bolt action rifle several enemy come kill want take stealth tactic want glorious gun battle well extremely difficult atleast hard difficulty take 6 pistol machine gun shot bring bad guy high power pistol desert eagle large magnum still take 23 shot per kill normally would fine realistic amount ammo 4050 round pistol mean cant really fight 5 enemy time enemy move gunshot ring pick additional ammo fairly difficult even impossible point yes secondary weapon might able use get 5 guy go run ammo even quickly many thing general game mechanic annoy well never saw bf3 4 starter story terrible farit awful contrive far fetch spoil trust awful realism miss one point perform getaway drive partner shoot thought could fun first wrong enemy also shoot back drive faster bad guy hang window shoot car drive barrier trailors etc guy never much duck car car spin hit barrier explodesdisappointing also much crap highway anyway point story idea next first thing annoy walk hood look guy talk new partner say guess know way around hu respond something like really guess im little rusty partner stop walk itwhat find way view current mission objective know suppose partner would budge nothing mini map even give clue periodic reminder objective either nothing consider restart checkpoint think bug eventually find oh need explore would nice know needed separate point story break mechanic little accidentyou watch someone walk building must identify certain person well use scanner get ahead guy im suppose watch find suspect long guy could get mark apparently sort marker move different room stand well guy get suspect originally still conversation empty space disappoint graphic general pretty good ps4 nothing unexpected get shootout shoot obstacle pretty neat gunfire mechanic really well do shotguns especially feel pretty powerful even graphic noticeable bug like couple cut scenes one character iseizure eye eye move back forth quickly time get two star gun fire graphic lose 3 base bug lack general mechanic terrible story
"i just received my upgrade dvd yesterday and tried to install it this morning. at first everything was smooth and easy, then the problems started. it wouldn't complete the upgrade until i removed something called the ""kasperskyanti virus"". this software was never loaded onto my computer. i called microsofts support and after 55 minutes and what seemed like hours of frustration (the tech barely spoke english and appeared to have no knowledge of how to solve my problem) the tech told me he would call me back with the proper solution to upgrade my system. well, it's been almost $ hours and no call back. anyway, i had to download 3 different anti virus removal tools, none worked. i finally found the solution. the problem is that kaspersky anti virus is a piece of the verizon security suite and a few other security programs so it doesn't show on your list of installed programs. so to beat this problem you have to uninstall all your anti virus programs and then windows 7 loads effortlessly. i wish i'd have thought of that before i wasted damn near 90 mins with microsoft's so- called ""tech support"".",1,software,receive upgrade dvd yesterday try install morning first everything smooth easy problem start would complete upgrade remove something call kasperskyanti virus software never load onto computer call microsofts support 55 minute seem like hour frustration tech barely speak english appear knowledge solve problem tech tell would call back proper solution upgrade system well almost $ hour call back anyway download 3 different anti virus removal tool none work finally find solution problem kaspersky anti virus piece verizon security suite security program show list installed program beat problem uninstall anti virus program windows 7 load effortlessly wish would thought waste damn near 90 min microsoft call tech support

"this headset looks and feels like quality, even the packaging was absolute perfection. this is only the second headset i've ever bought. the first i had no problems other than it breaking after years of use, but this headset caused so much frustration for me. i got everything set up, and was in love until i realized that the microphone was recording incredibly quietly. i'm already a quiet person, i don't want to yell any more than i have to. the headset came with no instructions, so i assumed i did something wrong, but upon googling my issue, it seems a lot of people have the same thing happening to them. you can only turn up your microphone through the cable sound mixer (which is extremely quiet and staticy according to friends). i tried changing so many settings, updating all kinds of drivers multiple times, recruiting computer genius friends - nothing. i even called their tech support, but was only asked a barrage of obvious questions i didn't have time for.

the only thing i could think that would fix it is to buy an audio splitter so i could ditch the detachable sound mixer, and try using both audio and microphone ports. i believe this has fixed my issue, it seems to be better, but i'm still incredibly disappointed that this headset didn't just work on its own. i'm confused and frustrated why it doesn't, after having it recommended as one of the best. now i have an extremely short cord with no way to manually adjust any volumes or mute. fun.

otherwise, this headset is very comfortable and well made. you can barely hear yourself when you speak, which i find annoying, but it's good to drown out all noise. i love the braided cord, it's a shame i can't use the second cord for the length at least.",1,game,headset look feel like quality even package absolute perfection second headset ever buy first problem break year use headset cause much frustration get everything set love realize microphone record incredibly quietly already quiet person want yell headset come instruction assume something wrong upon google issue seem lot people thing happen turn microphone cable sound mixer extremely quiet staticy accord friend try change many setting update kind driver multiple time recruit computer genius friends nothing even call tech support ask barrage obvious question time thing could think would fix buy audio splitter could ditch detachable sound mixer try use audio microphone port believe fix issue seem good still incredibly disappointed headset work confuse frustrate recommend one best extremely short cord way manually adjust volume mute fun otherwise headset comfortable well make barely hear speak find annoy good drown noise love braid cord shame use second cord length least

what i have to criticize about kindle is that some times, images and/or graphs in some books result too small and therefore difficult to visualize.
for example, i bought some books with music scores which are difficult to read from the screen of my net-book. it would be nice if there was a way to print pages (there is none within kindle), although when absolutely necessary (as when needing to have a music score on top of a piano as to read it while playing), one can always do a print-screen, edit the image and then print on a reasonable size of paper.",0,software,thanks kindle able read lot book would able otherwise book could find live time guarantee country print version would properly deliver mail service criticize kindle time image andor graphs book result small therefore difficult visualize example buy book music score difficult read screen netbook would nice way print page none within kindle although absolutely necessary need music score top piano read play one always printscreen edit image print reasonable size paper

"i purchased for the xbox one.  as of january 2014 it is the only early release kinect based game on xbox one.

gameplay
the ability to dance with up to four players is the game's strong point.  dances are very interactive and some modes include lifting the other player into the air and carrying them around which is highly entertaining especially when it's unexpected.  we played the game during new years eve celebrations and everyone had a great time.  there are some very unusual song selections such as aladdin and ghost busters.

the recorded videos of you and your friends busting out your club worthy dance moves is one of the most entertaining parts.

downside
the kinect does not read dance moves very accurately which makes it fairly easy to score when you clearly have no idea what on earth you are doing.  the game picks up people sitting on the couch and actually gives them scoring marks.  it's also very easy to start dancing as one player and move too far to your left or right and all of the sudden you are being registered in one of the other three player slots.  lastly, the game would  mix up which player was controlling the options and it was hard to get it reassigned especially if the game gave control to someone sitting randomly in the background.

"i've had every official remote for the ps3, and even a few usb clunkers. i even tried a usb dongle remote for the ps4, but all i could get to work was the navigation buttons on that one. now, this being a third party remote, it's not as well-made as the official sony remotes. it feels pretty light and cheap. the buttons are responsive, and seem to snap back in place, but do often make a clicking sound. this remote is slender, at about 2/3 the width of the old one, with a contoured feel. it feels nice in the hand, but comes at a price. the buttons are also smaller and in a very different configuration than the old one. i'm used to the shape buttons being on the four corners of the navigation ring in the center, but now they're lined up in a row. backlit keys would be nice, but i feel it would add some weight and price to the remote. this does work somewhat well as a universal remote. it controls not only the ps4, the tv and the amp, but also the cable/satellite. now, some of these buttons aren't necessarily the same as your old dvr remote, but i don't intend to use this remote full-time anyway. i could not get it to learn any new keys, despite the directions in the book. i got the volume punch-through to work on my tv, but it's been confirmed by the company that you will have to switch functions to change the volume on your amp. all in all, this is a very worthy successor for the ps3 remote, you just have to adjust your expectations a little. either way, it's much better than using the dualshock 4 controller for the tv apps.

update: this remote is handy while watching movies and netflix, but it's practically unusable while watching hulu plus. only the navigation buttons in the center work for play/pause, rewind/fast forward. the regular buttons for these functions don't work at all. and the shape buttons do absolutely nothing, which means you can't back out of menus to the previous screen. i'm taking off a star for limited functionality.

update 2: in the year that i've had the remote, sony or pdp has offered patches and updates. it functions much better now than before. much more intuitive with video apps, such as hulu and youtube. and the volume punchthrough works for whatever device you're using at the time. my only real complaint now is the size and placement of the buttons. but that can't really be helped since the width of the remote doesn't allow for them to be larger.",0,game,every official remote ps3 even usb clunkers even try usb dongle remote ps4 could get work navigation button one third party remote wellmade official sony remote feel pretty light cheap button responsive seem snap back place often make click sound remote slender 23 width old one contour feel feel nice hand come price button also small different configuration old one use shape button four corner navigation ring center line row backlit key would nice feel would add weight price remote work somewhat well universal remote control ps4 tv amp also cablesatellite button necessarily old dvr remote intend use remote fulltime anyway could get learn new key despite direction book get volume punchthrough work tv confirm company switch function change volume amp worthy successor ps3 remote adjust expectation little either way much well use dualshock 4 controller tv apps update remote handy watch movie netflix practically unusable watch hulu plus navigation button center work playpause rewindfast forward regular button function work shape button absolutely nothing mean back menus previous screen take star limited functionality update 2 year remote sony pdp offer patch updates function much well much intuitive video apps hulu youtube volume punchthrough work whatever device use time real complaint size placement button really help since width remote allow large

"if you're looking to relive the glory days of playing the iconic battlefront franchise of the playstation 2 era, you're in for a huge disappointment.  the new battlefront contains absolutely none of the third-person, edge-of-your-seat mayhem involving the uphill battle of capturing and holding command posts, strategically choosing which units to unlock and which bonuses to employ, and laying waste to your foes with a wide array of fun and futuristic vehicles.

instead, what ea dice has released is yet another first person shooter, albeit dressed up as a star wars game (and yes - i am aware that it's possible to toggle into 3rd person mode; frankly though, that does little to change the gameplay.  in its heart and soul, this game is an fps down to its core.)  this game should not even bear the battlefront moniker.  instead, it should be titled: ""star wars: 20 different ways to play deathmatch and capture the flag.""  it contains absolutely none of the nuance or strategy involved in the previous battlefront games.

initially, i assumed that perhaps it was the single player mode that was disappointing, and that i'd find more fun online.  well, i went to join an online match, only to find that i'd need to subscribe to playstation plus, at a price of $17.99 for three months, in order to do so.  so...in addition to paying $70 for the title, i'm also expected to shell out a monthly fee just to enjoy the multiplayer benefits.  what a sham.

in short, if you feel absolutely compelled to play this game, rent it or borrow if from a friend...and ask if you can use their playstation plus account.  don't waste your money on purchasing this title.",2,game,look relive glory day play iconic battlefront franchise playstation 2 era huge disappointment new battlefront contain absolutely none thirdperson edgeofyourseat mayhem involve uphill battle capture hold command post strategically choose unit unlock bonus employ lay waste foe wide array fun futuristic vehicle instead ea dice release yet another first person shooter albeit dress star war game yes aware possible toggle 3rd person mode frankly though little change gameplay heart soul game fps core game even bear battlefront moniker instead titletongue_sticking_out_cheeky_playful_or_blowing_a_raspberry star war 20 different way play deathmatch capture flag contain absolutely none nuance strategy involve previous battlefront game initially assume perhaps single player mode disappoint would find fun online well go join online match find would need subscribe playstation plus price $ 1799 three month order soin addition pay $ 70 title also expect shell monthly fee enjoy multiplayer benefit sham short feel absolutely compel play game rent borrow friendand ask use playstation plus account waste money purchasing title

"have you ever wanted to do more than just eliminate your enemies in a video game? have you ever wanted to torture your adversaries by making them walk through bear traps and humiliate them with a pie to the face? well, do i have the game for you and your oddly specific and disturbing desires. deception iv blood ties for the ps3/ps vita is a sort of real time strategy game in which you defeat your enemies utilizing a variety of traps and environmental hazards throughout the levels. this game is fun. it's very unique and original compared to any other title out there that's been released recently.

story
 the story follows laegrinna (who is the spawn of satan) and her three companion witches. each of the witches represents one of the category of traps in the game, humiliating, sadistic and elaborate. the four of them are after the pieces of some kind of ancient relic that when put together can be used to bring their master, the devil  himself, back to power. countless soldiers and heroes try to thwart the protagonists by marching like lemmings into deathtraps. i give them an a for effort but that's the best i can do.

gameplay
 the gameplay consists of placing traps throughout the levels on a grid. the three witches also give you optional challenges that reward you with extra points. there are multiple rooms to each level and each room has it's own hazards or traps you can set off as well. the most effective way to dispatch your enemies is to use traps in combination with each other. you rack up more points and experience if you can successfully land hits on enemies with trap combos. for example, you put a bear trap in front of a door. when some unsuspecting fool walks through the door bam he's stuck. then you use a swinging axe to knock that enemy onto a springboard which launches him across the map just to have a boulder dropped on his head. that's just a simple combo. you can upgrade the number of traps you can have active at one time by progressing through the game as well as the variety of traps. you have to purchase the traps using the points you earn in game before you can use them.
 when placing traps on the map, the game displays arrows which represent the direction of the trap and how far they will push or pull your enemy. the game does not however compensate for elevation or airborne enemies correctly. stairs mess this up a lot too. keep all that in mind when you set up elaborate trap combos because you'll end up placing a trap one space off and ruin your combo.
 you also gain abilities for laegrinna such as an enrage beam that forces enemies to follow you and an auto evasion ability because, i forgot to mention, the enemies are trying to kill you too; with guns and grenades and stuff. yea, it's not all a walk in the park for the player. there's a fair bit of challenge.
 enemies who are invulnerable to certain traps require you to study their abilities using the devil eye. you can be facing up to three enemies at once who want nothing better than to hit you when your trying to activate your traps on their friends. agile enemies will just straight up ninja their way out of traps. this challenge is welcomed since a game where every enemy blindly walked into the same traps every time would get boring, though sometimes that does happen depending on the enemy and the trap. if you manage to hit an enemy's weakness and do enough damage their armor comes off leaving them in their underwear adding even more insult to injury as well as removing the enemy's invulnerabilities.
 enemies can also be captured using capture traps within the levels and some are worth a whole lot of  bonus points.

features
 the game includes a challenge mode separate from the main story in which you have to meet certain goals or criteria to complete each mission such as score a 6-hit combo or defeat all enemies within the time limit. there is also a mode that allows you to download/upload custom challenges via psn. you can also save replays. as i said before, there are a vast number and variety of traps to unlock in the game. upon completing the story mode you gain the ability to unlock new costumes for laegrinna. the game does not have touch screen support on the vita but it really isn't necessary.

presentation
 the story is told through visual novel type dialog where a portrait of the character is displayed on screen along with text. there is no english voice acting, only english subtitles. the voice acting however is excellent and if you don't mind reading you'll be satisfied with the story and characters being presented like this. the art style of the characters being of anime style is new to the series (in case you remember or played any of the previous games 10 years or so ago) and looks good. the menus are clear and concise as well. the frame rate is solid and the game as a whole runs flawlessly with quick load times.

graphics/art style
 the game looks very good on the vita. no jaggies or anything like that. it's all crisp. the environments are fairly detailed albeit a tad simplistic. this is a commonality in some japanese games. the character models get a good amount of detail whereas the environments not so much. if you know what i'm talking about then  you'll know this doesn't really detract from the game in any way. and as i briefly mentioned, the character models are pretty good. the armor the enemies wear is a blend of modern and medieval styles and look pretty cool.

sound/music
 as i previously mentioned the game is in japanese. the quality of the voice acting is great as well. the characters will make noises and cry out in pain when they get hurt. the game also provides audio cues when a trap successfully lands or is avoided and when enemies attack. the use of audio cues definitely aids the player in keeping track what's going on in the level. the music is nice and provides subtle background noise while playing. the levels each have their own music. the amusement park for example has well, amusement park sounding music and sound effects. there's even a merry-go-round trap you can use that has it's own music.

controls
 there isn't to much to talk about here. everything responds fine and the layout is simple. a majority of your button pushes is just going to be selecting traps and placing them on the map.

replay factor
 beating the game unlocks costumes.

 deception iv: blood ties is another great addition to the ps vita's and ps3's library of niche japanese titles. the unique, fun, and solid gameplay will keep players entertained for hours. over time one might feel that the gameplay is repetitive but constantly unlocking traps and experimenting with them provides enough variation. this is the type of game geared for perfectionists. those who like to get the highest scores or biggest combo possible. you don't have to be that way to enjoy it though. if you're interested in new types of games with different gameplay and enjoy anime art styles then pick this one up for sure. i encourage anyone who likes anime style games or strategy games to at least check it out. if you play it and decide you want more, you could track down a copy of one of the older ps games (tecmo's deception and kagero: deception 2) or  ps2 game (dark delusion: deception 3) on amazon. just don't try to make sense of how the titles work. you'll hurt your

i verified that both the deluxe dlc and the season pass were both downloaded and linked to the for honor game file (seen under ""manage game""). as far as i could see the base game worked fine though i didn't get past the tutorial and menus. there are a number of this same complaint on ubisoft's xbox one forum page and it looks like some ps4 users are having a similar issue. i tried reaching out to ubisoft's customer service with zero response. i attempted to wait in a queue for a 'live chat' with someone from cs and after about an hour and still over 100 people ahead of me i quit. i've uninstalled the game and am sooooooo thankful to amazon for their return policy. until you can confirm that this issue is fixed, avoid like the plague.",2,game,* * review solely pertain gold edition relate content * * receive gold edition physical copy instal game redeem gold edition code launch game restart post beta emblem creation open tutorial process land main menu screen course go look additional item deluxe gold package say contain frustration nothing double check suppose receive able find via ubisoft website confirm miss item verify deluxe dlc season pas download link honor game file see manage game far could see base game work fine though get past tutorial menu number complaint ubisoft xbox one forum page look like ps4 user similar issue try reach ubisoft customer service zero response attempt wait queue live chat someone cs hour still 100 people ahead quit uninstalled game sooooooo thankful amazon return policy confirm issue fix avoid like plague

"my fiancee' and i are huge bethesda fans, both of us have put in over 2000 hours over the years among their various products in their catalog before morrowind and have purchased collectors editions, when we lucky to obtain them, and if not lucky, always their physical product. so we were excited to play, to have the physical product, and avoid having to download 25+ gigabytes of data over our 3g cellphone tethered connection. so what do we get when we get the package?

1 disk with 5.2 gigabytes of data to preinstall before having to rely on steam for the other 4/5ths of the game i purchased. this is unacceptable. this was the whole purpose of obtaining a physical copy so that we, may in fact, avoid having to download 20+ gigabytes over the course of 2 days on what amounts to a 2 meg down connection tops!!!! bethesda couldn't even be bothered to use one dual-layer dvd!!! what would of it costed you bethesda for just 2 dual layer dvds and having us download an additional 4 gigabytes of data instead!!!!! that would of at least been tolerable.. there is no warning on this page, no indication that you will have to download an additional 20+ gigabytes after install... waste of time and money.  you have just made a pirate!!!!

update: after attempting contact to their customer service this is what i get: *** keep in mind i didn""t complain about either one of these issues but the issue that was previously stated!! ***

"i do not know any italian. i bought level 1 of the rosetta stone about 7 weeks ago from off their radio adds. i have put in nearly one hour a day for approx four days a week. i am disappointed in this product. there is value, but you will need to purchase other software or books to supplement as other reviewers have stated.

here are some of my issues, though there are others: no explantory text. you see 4 pictures and the voice says it in italian and you must choose 1 of the 4 pictures. while this has some value, the lack of explantory text would be extremely helpful. i have no idea if i said ""the boy is jumping"" or ""a boy is leaping"". while i get the idea he is jumping/leaping, it would be helpful to know what i am saying so if i ask something in italian, i start the sentence structure out correctly. the other negative is how they use the word bambino vs. ragazzo vs. figlio. all three mean boy or male child. specifically, bambino can and does mean ""baby"" while figlio means ""son"". rosetta stone does a poor job of distinguishing this ""at"" times in their pictures. thirdly, there were many pictures where you really can't identify if it is boy or girl (those of you who have gone through this one know what i am talking about).

"i have print shop versions 10 and 20 and have successfully used them on my xp machines for years.  i like the calendars and the ability of put pictures in wherever i wanted...in front of the dates, at the end of the dates, as a watermark behind the dates, on the dates....

i create calendars for fund-raisers and so with this ability have been able to add more photos to a 12 month calendar. people count on my calendars to look this way!

how hard can it be to make a solid, working, non-crashing, non-freezing win7 version of print shop?

apparently too hard, i guess.  shame on you broderbund!  shame!!!!!

i do a winxp partition on my pc but my older version is somewhat glitchy even then.  i'm glad my laptop with xp on it is still chugging along or i'd be....well, you know what i'd be.

when you install the drive bay over this 3rd party connector, the part does not allow it to lay flat on the main board without flexing it. what this means is that you cannot fully tighten the screws so it remains slightly lifted. when you finish reassembling the nes, the cartridge will not go down and click into place. however, you can still play the games, but you can't press the cartridge down.

"at first, things seemed to be going well with this controller. i liked the look and feel of it, and the buttons/sticks/triggers were responsive. i was a little put off by the fact that the controller is smaller than a standard xbox 360 controller, but it wasn't really an issue and i adjusted quickly. the nicest feature, and the main reason i bought it, were the customizable wheels on the back of the controller. it was great to be able to map certain buttons to these, so i could activate them without having to take my thumb off the sticks--an especially useful feature in fast-paced fps games.

but, then things fell apart. suddenly, while playing battlefield 4, my character began aiming down sights as though i was pressing the left trigger--even though i wasn't pressing anything. curiously, it stopped happening after a few seconds, and i went back to playing. before long, however, this situation was happening all the time, and it made it impossible to play the game. another reviewer referenced this issue happening to them, and they appear to be right: it might have something to do with the vibrations from the controller confusing the inputs into thinking you're pressing the trigger. a few times, i slapped the controller out of frustration and it actually made my character on the screen stop aiming--but only for a couple seconds before it started up again. i returned this controller for a standard, wireless 360 controller, and i'm happy to report there are no problems.

bottom line: i've never had a defective 360 controller out of the four i've owned. this is the one non-standard controller i've bought, and it failed within a few days. the benefits from the wheels on the back of the controller and the neat design don't outweigh the potential drawbacks.",2,game,first thing seem go well controller liked look feel buttonsstickstriggers responsive little put fact controller small standard xbox 360 controller really issue adjust quickly nice feature main reason buy customizable wheel back controller great able map certain button could activate without take thumb sticksan especially useful feature fastpaced fps game thing fell apart suddenly play battlefield 4 character begin aim sight though press leave triggereven though press anything curiously stop happen second go back play long however situation happen time make impossible play game another reviewer reference issue happen appear right might something vibration controller confuse input think pressing trigger time slap controller frustration actually make character screen stop aimingbut couple second start return controller standard wireless 360 controller happy report problem bottom line never defective 360 controller four own one nonstandard controller buy fail within day benefit wheel back controller neat design outweigh potential drawback

"this game is fun. the graphics are great, the controls are responsive, and it could arguably be one of the best racing games ever released on a console...

...if microsoft/turn 10 would let their customers play the game they paid for without trying to  nickel-and-dime them throughout the entire experience.

i played forza motorsport 4, my favorite sim racer to date, for well over 1000 hours. where was the majority of that time spent? in free play mode with a friend. in forza 5, there is an extremely limited pool of cars that a guest has access to in the event that you want to race locally with a friend who, say, does not own an xbox one. they have the option of either creating a profile and spending a ludicrous amount of time to get the cars they want or they can simply buy them at ludicrous prices. want the top three cars in the game? that will either take you an eternity to save in-game credits for, or you can simply buy them for the low price of $100.

the pricing model in this game would be significantly more appropriate if the game was free. however, microsoft has taken a free-to-play model and applied it to a full-price launch title.

microsoft: this is not the way to start a new generation. it is not fair to your fans, who were looking forward to this title for months only to be given a watered-down version at full price. it is not even fair to your own developers who certainly worked hard on this game only to have it ruined by greed, which is why i did not have the heart to give this game the lowest rating that i could.",2,game,game fun graphic great control responsive could arguably one best racing game ever release console microsoftturn 10 would let customer play game pay without try nickelanddime throughout entire experience play forza motorsport 4 favorite sim racer date well 1000 hour majority time spend free play mode friend forza 5 extremely limited pool car guest access event want race locally friend say xbox one option either create profile spending ludicrous amount time get car want simply buy ludicrous price want top three car game either take eternity save ingame credit simply buy low price $ 100 pricing model game would significantly appropriate game free however microsoft take freetoplay model apply fullprice launch title microsoft way start new generation fair fan look forward title month give watereddown version full price even fair developer certainly work hard game ruin greed heart give game low rating could

"i have been looking at the reviews to see if people have been having the same problems that i have. i have just found out why: the game does save your changes but it is saving them to a different folder, the common folder. to solve the problem you must change the name of the common folder to that of the installation folder and here is how you do it:

1. go to ""start"" (on the bottom left-hand corner of your screen), click ""run"" and type in ""regedit"" in the prompt.
2. go to ""hkey"", then ""local machine"" and find ""konami"".
3. go into konami and alter the common directory (commondir) value so it reads:
c:\program files\konami\yu-gi-oh! power of chaos yugi the destiny\common files

problem solved!

how do i find this game? it is at its best if you have joey the passion, because you can import cards from yugi into joey (doesn't seem to go the other way, though). i like the theme music. the tutorial is way too basic and is only for absolute beginners.

overall, i would rate joey the passion as far superior. joey has a ""level-up"" from absolute beginners to advanced. as you advance, so does joey, and he is a far more versatile player. he uses different combinations, strategies and decks.

however, i must say yugi is polite, whether you win or. joey sometimes says ""you stink"" and kaiba is even more arrogant - he sometimes calls you ""a pathetic dog!"" still, if you are a fan of the show, you know to expect remarks like that from kaiba.

anyway, if you want to add more cards to joey or kaiba, definitely have yugi the destiny.",1,game,look review see people problem find game save change save different folder common folder solve problem must change name common folder installation folder 1 go start bottom lefthand corner screen click run type regedit prompt 2 go hkey local machine find konami 3 go konami alter common directory commondir value read c\program files\konami\yugioh power chaos yugi destiny\common file problem solve find game best joey passion import card yugi joey seem go way though like theme music tutorial way basic absolute beginner overall would rate joey passion far superior joey levelup absolute beginner advance advance joey far versatile player use different combination strategy deck however must say yugi polite whether win joey sometimes say stink kaiba even arrogant sometimes call pathetic dog still fan show know expect remark like kaiba anyway want add card joey kaiba definitely yugi destiny

"i first saw this item in our local warehouse club ($99.00) and tried to talk my husband into buying it.  he was very skeptical, thinking there was no way one could get a gps system for under a $100.00. after reading the reviews on amazon.com, we decided to order from amazon and go for it.

we have used it locally, as well as on a 12 hour trip from ohio to connecticut and back again.  the unit worked nearly flawlessly for this trip.  for some reason, it lost the signal in and around scranton pa both coming and going, but i am wondering if it was satellite or weather related, as we had terrible storms while going through this area!  otherwise, it took us from our driveway in ohio to my daughters' apartment in connecticut and back again.  we used it for a few side trips in and around connecticut, and had no problems whatsoever.

the installation process was a breeze, and we had very few problems during use.  even when we intentionally made a few wrong turns, all you do is hit the f3 key, and it recalculates your route very quickly. (we installed this on a newer sony vaio laptop)

the software itself is very good, and before we left home, we were able to download updates for construction, so we knew what to expect along the way.  (internet connection required for updates).

while driving in the car, it can be difficult, at times, to hear the spoken directions through the small laptop speakers.  to remedy this, i bought a tape adapter so that the directions could be heard through my car stereo system . (the adapter is a cassette tape, with a wire at one end, and a headphone jack at the other that connects into the laptop.....crank up the volume in the car, and presto, you are set!)

all in all, we are very pleased with this package.  you can't beat it for the price, that's for sure.  amazon now has it $20.00 cheaper than what we paid for it, so it is even a better bargain!  go for it!",0,software,first saw item local warehouse club $ 9900 tried talk husband buying skeptical think way one could get gps system $ 10000 read review amazoncom decide order amazon go use locally well 12 hour trip ohio connecticut back unit work nearly flawlessly trip reason lose signal around scranton pa come go wonder satellite weather relate terrible storm go area otherwise take u driveway ohio daughter apartment connecticut back used side trip around connecticut problem whatsoever installation process breeze problem use even intentionally make wrong turn hit f3 key recalculates route quickly instal new sony vaio laptop software good leave home able download update construction know expect along way internet connection require update drive car difficult time hear spoken direction small laptop speaker remedy bought tape adapter direction could hear car stereo system adapter cassette tape wire one end headphone jack connect laptopcrank volume car presto set pleased package beat price sure amazon $ 2000 cheap pay even good bargain go

"first off, my prejudice. i despise microsoft and word and what bill gates and company have done to the computing industry while calling out about all the innovation they are actually suppressing. there used to be many word processing programs and now there are relatively few. whatever programs are still out there must be able to operate in the windows operating environment as well as convert files to and from word, which bill gates bundled free for a while with the computers being sold. that said, i have liked wordperfect since wordperfect 5.1 from old dos days. i wish wordperfect had kept their own spreadsheet software program (called planperfect). instead, that got ash canned and borland's quattropro was substituted.

i have no complaints about wordperfect (my word processing needs are rather small. my concerns are with quattropro. there are several infuriating bugs in version x6. at least on my machine. these have never been fixed. in x6. (do not know if they have been fixed in x7.) the bugs on my machine at least is inability to use the numeric keypad to call up one of the last files. i must use the numbers at the top of the computer keyboard. also, borland's quattro pro has a more infuriating bug. at times, it crashes when i hit control and s to save a file. i then lose all work since i last saved the file. the problem has lessened because i do not use the aero look in my windows 7 64 bit pro machine. and i set my mouse to windows standard instead of windows aero. the fact that i am still using word perfect and quattro pro is that i despise microsoft's products so much.",1,software,first prejudice despise microsoft word bill gate company do compute industry call innovation actually suppress use many word processing program relatively whatever program still must able operate window operate environment well convert file word bill gate bundle free computer sell say like wordperfect since wordperfect 51 old do day wish wordperfect kept spreadsheet software program call planperfect instead get ash can borland quattropro substitute complaint wordperfect word processing need rather small concern quattropro several infuriate bug version x6 least machine never fix x6 know fix x7 bug machine least inability use numeric keypad call one last file must use number top computer keyboard also borland quattro pro infuriate bug time crash hit control save file lose work since last save file problem lessen use aero look windows 7 64 bit pro machine set mouse windows standard instead windows aero fact still use word perfect quattro pro despise microsoft product much

one aspect of mp 3 that i love is the overt homage the game designers and writers pay to the original games. without giving any spoilers away, just rest assured that if you fell in love with the first game, its storyline (and music), you'll not be disappointed with mp 3.

"this is a great game, a must have for anyone who has an xbox. it has great graphics, great gameplay, great sound, and a great story. i can't think of much that's bad about it. the only thing i can think of is that some of the level designs are repeated, but this is made up for with new enemies and new objectives. it definitely doesn't take away from the overall game.
also, i saw a number of reviews here talking about how they thought the game was too short. i have played through the first 2 difficulty settings and got through them pretty quick. now i'm on the the 3rd of 4 (they are called easy, normal, heroic, and legendary), and i'm already stuck on level three. i have talked to people online who have beaten the game on legendary without co-op mode, and they have said that easy and normal are too easy to beat and everyone that hasn't beaten it on legendary cannot say that they have beaten the game. legendary is much, much harder and takes a lot longer. one of the game programmers took somewhere around 64 hours to complete the game on legendary. that should give you an idea of how long it takes an average gamer.",0,game,great game must anyone xbox great graphic great gameplay great sound great story think much bad thing think level design repeat make new enemy new objective definitely take away overall game also saw number review talk thought game short play first 2 difficulty setting get pretty quick 3rd 4 call easy normal heroic legendary already stick level three talked people online beaten game legendary without coop mode say easy normal easy beat everyone beaten legendary say beaten game legendary much much hard take lot long one game programmer take somewhere around 64 hour complete game legendary give idea long take average gamer

"i have been using office since 1992 and frankly i was getting a little tired of the same look and feel.  well, after win xp came out i knew it was only a matter of time before microsoft made office look and feel more lively.
well, as soon as the beta version became available in june i purchased my copy of the 2003 office and the whole bundle of the other products.  i was a little reluctant to use the beta version for safety and stability reasons but i have to say that except for frontpage 2003, all other software is 100% stable as a beta version.  this only goes to show that the product really was programmed well.
not a lot of change in the word and excel except for a few new things.  however, outlook now looks fantastic and is incredibly productive.  what a wonderful change...  the look and feel of outlook is finally modernized and it is very useful in the office.  i am ceo of a small company and we always struggled to keep a good track of our customers.  with outlook 2003' contact manager that is now a snap.  for example, every time you send an email to a client that you have previously registered in outlook as a customer, the email automatically becomes attached to that account.  so, tomorrow you can just go the customers account and you will see all the emails they sent you and the ones you sent them all in one place.  i love that!
powerpoint has also gotten nicer.  many more transitions and themes.  all around powerpoint has always been a good piece of software and you can't fix something if it ain't broken.
access looks great too.  i think outlook and access both got a lot of things changed.  i must say we use mysql for our company but if you are an access person, you will like the changes.
all and all i would absolutely recommend a change if you have a 2000 or older version of office.  but if you are happy with your office xp now, really don't waste your money in this poor economy.
hope this helps!",0,software,use office since 1992 frankly get little tired look feel well win xp come knew matter time microsoft make office look feel lively well soon beta version become available june purchase copy 2003 office whole bundle product little reluctant use beta version safety stability reason say except frontpage 2003 software 100 % stable beta version go show product really program well lot change word excel except new thing however outlook look fantastic incredibly productive wonderful change look feel outlook finally modernize useful office ceo small company always struggle keep good track customer outlook 2003 contact manager snap example every time send email client previously register outlook customer email automatically become attached account tomorrow go customer account see emails sent one send one place love powerpoint also get nicer many transition theme around powerpoint always good piece software fix something ai broken access look great think outlook access get lot thing change must say use mysql company access person like change would absolutely recommend change 2000 old version office happy office xp really waste money poor economy hope help

"bought paperport 14 pro direct from nuance.  $99. downloaded and installed.  it would open, i could see the proper screen with my old icons from pp11, then immediately go away and leave me with a box - ""warning 1909""  called nuance support at the phone number on their web site and talked to a nice english speaking lady, who said all she could do was to give me a different phone number for ""tech support"".  and not a toll free number at that.

i called ""tech support"" and after a wait of maybe 4 minutes, was connected to a person undeniably in india, who could neither speak nor understand english.  after many minutes of repeating myself over and over, i hung up.  called the same number again the next day at 8:00 am when they open.  different person, but exact same problem.  neither of us could understand the other.  again, in utter disgust, hung up.  but in those 2 messages, all i got was to uninstall and reinstall, using their own patented ""uninstaller"", included in the software, especially made to uninstall paperport 14.  does that sound like they might be having problems if they must develop a special uninstaller ???  i uninstalled and re-installed a total of 5 times, all with the same error message.

called the third time to request a refund.  i assume i will get it, but time will tell.  they spent much more time in having me answer ""yes"" to 2 questions that basically said i will remove the software (could not wait to do so) and would destroy the cd i also ordered, than anyone ever spent in trying to fix the problem.

and, in the process of loading 14, it also wiped out my working version 11.  had to dig out the original cd and re-install.

"i bought this strait from quicken because they offered me 50% off but i see it is selling for the same amount on amazon now.

i recently upgraded from 2012 because of the 3 year support issue. that is, quicken will only support the product for three years. you can use it for longer than that if you do not need/want any of the online tools but i depend on those tools heavily so i choose to upgrade.

upgrading was easy and flawless. i believe that i have a fairly complex setup with numerous accounts in every category. i have jury rigged h&b to track my rental properties that are held in two different llcs since i have only heard horror stories about the rental property version of quicken and it does not look like it will do what i want it to do anyway. which is to maintain my business and personal accounts separately. i do this with a mix of business accounts, cash accounts (for income and expense tracking) and tags and i can assure you that it is less than perfect but gets the job done. i also have several investment accounts and have done some creative investing with options and such that quicken was able to track, if less than perfectly. everything transferred to 2015 fine and all of my one step updates continue to work. in fact, 2015 identified a couple of issues with updates that 2012 was having and fixed them. so overall, i am pleased with that aspect.

i would have to say that the most disappointing thing is that it looks and acts exactly the same. there is something to be said for ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" and i certainly wouldn't want to have to relearn or redo my system due to changes, but still, it has been three years. there are some additional features that i haven't really had time to play with and aren't huge selling points for me, just nice to haves. for example, the credit reporting. i already use credit karma and my credit card does this for free so not really necessary. also, the mobile capabilities. i'll be honest, i'm a little afraid to try this because of some of the things i've read. the bigger hang up, though, is that i have a windows phone (don't judge) which isn't supported. what i really need is the ability to enter things online, not just mobily (is that a word?), but if that is possible i haven't figured it out yet.

so every three years when i am forced to upgrade i go through the process of seeing what else is out there and the bottom line is that nothing else compares. there are certainly better options for basic money management and budgeting, and better options for tracking investments, and better options for for tracking business expenses, but nothing puts it all together like this. and i am just too invested to switch. so i continue to back up regularly and force quicken to do what i need it to do and upgrade every three years. i gave this four stars because there really isn't anything else that does what i need in one package but docked it one star because there are certainly times that quicken makes me want to put a fist through my screen.",0,software,buy strait quicken offer 50 % see selling amount amazon recently upgraded 2012 3 year support issue quicken support product three year use longer needwant online tool depend tool heavily choose upgrade upgrading easy flawless believe fairly complex setup numerous account every category jury rig h & b track rental property hold two different llcs since heard horror story rental property version quicken look like want anyway maintain business personal account separately mix business account cash account income expense track tags assure less perfect get job do also several investment account do creative investing option quicken able track less perfectly everything transfer 2015 fine one step update continue work fact 2015 identified couple issue update 2012 fixed overall pleased aspect would say disappointing thing look act exactly something say ai break fix certainly would want relearn redo system due change still three year additional feature really time play huge selling point nice have example credit report already use credit karma credit card free really necessary also mobile capability honest little afraid try thing read big hang though window phone judge support really need ability enter thing online mobily word possible figure yet every three year force upgrade go process see els bottom line nothing els compare certainly good option basic money management budget good option track investment well option track business expense nothing put together like invest switch continue back regularly force quicken need upgrade every three year give four star really anything els need one package dock one star certainly time quicken make want put fist screen

"from the description peerla sounded like the answer to my apa woes and i eagerly installed it when it arrived.  it does have step by step forms that generate an apa reference at the end, but that's about the only thing that it does satisfactorily.
you must start your document as a perrla document.  i assumed that as a word add-in, as the product was described, it would run on any word document, even one i had created before, but i didn't find a way to do that short of a hack with cut and paste.

you can't export references, someone else asked about this back in 2011 and the answer from liz huber of perrla was that they had thought about having an export feature, but ""do not look for it in the near future.""  it looks like it won't be available in the far future either yes, you can hack it and put references in an empty perrla doc and then cut and paste them elsewhere, but that's not really the point.

every time you create a perrla document it pops up a hokey window that loads this and that and checks for connectivity, it gets annoying very quickly.

perrla is worth about 10$-$15 for what it does.  it is probably suitable for a high school or the bachelors level in college.  come masters level it starts getting dubious.  at the doctoral level, it just doesn't make the grade except as a little utility for creating an apa reference.  mendeley has its problems too, but it has many more features than peerla, for instance export ability, and it's free for the first two gb.

"i never write these reviews, but i feel that i must based on the information that is available under the reviews as they are polarized and only vaguely helpful.

second, my rating would be 4.5 stars, but amazon doesn't allow that.  i would rate this product five stars except for the support issue which is a problem.  i actually think it is not as big an issue as many of the other reviewers.

third, i'm a huge goldmine fan (gm) - i purchased mine on amazon at the end of aug 2004 - and i am completely hooked.  i recommend this program to anyone that needs any type of customer relationship management (crm) software for any business because it will do everything that you can imagine.  yes, gm does has warts, but so does salesforce.com, or act (which i have used in the past) or anything else.  gm is very cheap and an incredibly powerful product for what it can do.

i consider myself to be very computer savvy and to get gm working the way that you want it too, this is helpful.  any other database (including act!) requires some user savvy to work too.  i wish i had been aware of the following before i purchased gm from amazon:

1.  (acutally i did this.) free 30-day trial from [...] - so try it before you buy it (but buy it here - amazon has the cheapest prices).
2.  there is no support (hence less than 5 stars) from frontrange.  however there are a enormous amount of people out there who can (and will) help you.  the support is primarily through a newsgroup identified on frontrange's website.
3.  gm, like any other sophisticated crm relies on you to make it work for you.  if you don't have a lot of contacts then outlook is probably all you need.  however, it really helps if you are technologically inclined before you purchase this product because, although you can use it straight out of the box, to make gm really work you will need to modify this program to your needs (same as act!).  if you're not technologically inclined there are many gm consultants who will charge you a fee to assist you.  don't call me, i'm not a gm consultant.
4.  you can read the manual for this product at [...] and you can also dowload two 450+ page manuals written by frontrange that will help you understand what gm can and cannot do.  (does this sound like a lot of work for a $165 product? - sure, but this product is worth the effort.  if you are inveting in a database do you want to trust your data to chance? the cost of bad data, and a poorly designed and not particularly powerful product is a lot more than $165!!)
5.  this product will do anything that you need if you're looking for a database.  yes, anything.  hence to get value (this product does work straight out of the box) but it really excels when you customize it.  any database is only as good as your ideas for making it work.
6.  since august i have entered more than 100,000 contacts into gm - i'm in a contact intensive field - and this program is invaluable for keeping in contact with people.  excellent reminders for everything - one nice feature: you can set the alarm so that gm sends you a text message to your phone telling you that you have an appointment and the text includes the other person's tel number.  this feature has reminded me of potentially missed meetings and calls on a number of occassions - worth $165 right there.
7.  this is a full working database - and it is extremely fast and compact - for example i had 25,000 contacts in outlook and the search function was incredibly slow was molasses trying to get around it.  the act file was close to 600mb in size.  gm whizzes - the same db is a trim 150mb, with much faster look ups.  however, like any other database it requires a lot of effort on behalf of the user to ensure that the product is changed so that it works the way you want it too.
8.  if more than one person is going to access the database, gm makes it easy for multiple users to access the database.  this product is exceptionally scaleable.  you can have 1 person or 100s of people working the same database.
9.  the best support is through what i would loosely term the ""gm community.""  through the frontrange website you can access a newsgroup (look under the support) where people post questions which are answered by people who subscribe to the community.  there is a wealth of information there.  however, if you're the sort of person that gets scared at the idea that you might have to understand what the computer is doing, then stick with outlook.  there are a large number of gm consultants who do charge money for their services - in many ways this is no different than microsoft or many of the other large companies.  many of these consultants publish answers to questions on the newsgroup for no charge.  let's face it, if it's a business threatening emergency wouldn't you want a specialist to be able to get to work right away?  with so many consultants available there is nearlys always one on hand.
10. the mail merge feature alone is invaluable and easy to use, (although it is not a full html email product).  you can, however, (through purchase of an add-on product) still use outlook as your e-mail client, with the advantage that your goldmine address book can be hidden from the outlook directory.  outlook is fully integrated.  so when you get an email in outlook, gm automatically appends a reference to that message to a contact in it's database, so that you have all of that person's messages in the one place.  in addition, all email attachments are linked to that contact.
11.  any file can be linked to a contact and the link is ""hot.""  the link is a shortcut to the file so with one click you can retrieve all of your letters or documents associated with a contact.
12.  importing data into gm is easy.
13. it is incredibly easy to keep on top of a long list of tasks.  i regularly make upward of 100 phonecalls a day, with follow on calls required many times because i don't get people.  i need a product where i can find all of our interaction with one client, and all in one place.  under each contact in gm you can store all of the emails, telephone calls, actions that you have taken, appointments, etc.
14.  the lookup feature is a little quirky and not what i was expecting.  it took me a little getting used to (a few hours) but once you get the hang of it, it is really fast and efficient.

overall:

strengths - alsolutely robust, an intelligent, well put together product with an exceptional value for the price - the best $165 i've spent in years.  obviously, i highly recommend this product.

weaknesses - lack of support from frontrange, requires the user to read up on the product and want to work with it.",0,software,never write review feel must base information available review polarize vaguely helpful second rating would 45 star amazon allow would rate product five star except support issue problem actually think big issue many reviewer third huge goldmine fan gm purchase mine amazon end aug 2004 completely hooked recommend program anyone need type customer relationship management crm software business everything imagine yes gm wart salesforcecom act use past anything els gm cheap incredibly powerful product consider computer savvy get gm work way want helpful database include act require user savvy work wish aware follow purchased gm amazon 1 acutally free 30day trial try buy buy amazon cheapest price 2 support hence less 5 star frontrange however enormous amount people help support primarily newsgroup identified frontrange website 3 gm like sophisticated crm relies make work lot contact outlook probably need however really help technologically inclined purchase product although use straight box make gm really work need modify program need act technologically inclined many gm consultant charge fee assist call gm consultant 4 read manual product also dowload two 450+ page manual write frontrange help understand gm sound like lot work $ 165 product sure product worth effort inveting database want trust data chance cost bad data poorly design particularly powerful product lot $ 165 5 product anything need look database yes anything hence get value product work straight box really excels customize database good idea make work 6 since august enter 100000 contact gm contact intensive field program invaluable keep contact people excellent reminder everything one nice feature set alarm gm send text message phone tell appointment text include person tel number feature remind potentially missed meeting call number occassions worth $ 165 right 7 full work database extremely fast compact example 25000 contact outlook search function incredibly slow molasses try get around act file close 600mb size gm whiz db trim 150mb much fast look ups however like database require lot effort behalf user ensure product change work way want 8 one person go access database gm make easy multiple user access database product exceptionally scaleable 1 person 100 people work database 9 best support would loosely term gm community frontrange website access newsgroup look support people post question answer people subscribe community wealth information however sort person get scar idea might understand computer stick outlook large number gm consultant charge money service many way different microsoft many large company many consultant publish answer question newsgroup charge let face business threaten emergency would want specialist able get work right away many consultant available nearlys always one hand 10 mail merge feature alone invaluable easy use although full html email product however purchase addon product still use outlook email client advantage goldmine address book hidden outlook directory outlook fully integrated get email outlook gm automatically append reference message contact database person message one place addition email attachment link contact 11 file link contact link hot link shortcut file one click retrieve letter document associate contact 12 import data gm easy 13 incredibly easy keep top long list task regularly make upward 100 phonecalls day follow call require many time get people need product find interaction one client one place contact gm store email telephone call action take appointment etc 14 lookup feature little quirky expect take little get use hour get hang really fast efficient overall strength alsolutely robust intelligent well put together product exceptional value price best $ 165 spend year obviously highly recommend product weaknesses lack support frontrange require user read product want work

"this controller is an okay replacement for the original snes controllers, but not as good. the reason why this controller is not as good as the original snes controllers is because the buttons are not as sensitive to button presses unlike the original which have very sensitive buttons; the buttons after using them for several months or a little bit more start to sink down more inside the controller because the springs are not as strong as the ones in the original controllers are. in addition, they are made cheaper than the original controllers and are not as durable, so they will not last as long. my recommendation is to not buy these controllers and get refurbished original super nintendo controllers on (...) or the exact replica version because they use the same exact materials to make those controllers as nintendo does for their controllers. the only difference is the exact replica's do not have the nintendo logo on it. i got two refurbished original super nintendo controllers from that website and they work excellently and they will last for many years. and another thing about the new port controllers, the first time you use them, the d-pad buttons are rather stiff and eventually lossen up after using them for a while and become easier to use. a last warning about the controller, the down function on the d-pad does not work very good, unlike on the original super nintendo cotrollers, the down function on the d-pad works excellently.",2,game,controller okay replacement original snes controller good reason controller good original snes controller button sensitive button press unlike original sensitive button button use several month little bit start sink inside controller spring strong one original controller addition make cheap original controller durable last long recommendation buy controller get refurbish original super nintendo controller exact replica version use exact material make controller nintendo controller difference exact replica nintendo logo get two refurbish original super nintendo controller website work excellently last many year another thing new port controller first time use dpad button rather stiff eventually lossen use become easy use last warning controller function dpad work good unlike original super nintendo cotrollers function dpad work excellently

- after opening it the glasses were bent up from the poor packaging and do not sit on my face correctly.

2. noisy. if you have one of the older 360s, you probably have a loud drive... this power supply is actually louder. forget the immersive experience unless you're playing a flight simulator or some sort of vacuum tycoon game, in which case the whine will add to the ambiance.

3. dirty power. this is most disappointing since it affects your video output. noise is introduced into the video and causes ""streaking"".

"turbotax got the job done, which is what matters, but it does have highly obnoxious flaws. most of my reason for purchasing tt again was not wanting to re-enter all my information from last year since i have used the online version repeatedly and my returns are similar year after year. after a lot of frustration i learned that tt will import the pdf i saved of of my previous return, but only if it was created by competing software, not tt. you have to get a .tax file from tt online to import old data, but turbotax online idiotically provides it in a file format also rejected by the program. about the time i typed in socials and birthdays i tried renaming the file to a .tax2012 file format. windows assured me that changing the file format would probably result in the destabilization of the known free world, or at least my computer, but this time the program accepted the file and i was in business.

i was more troubled by the program saying that filing married filing separately would 'probably' be best. that was a change so i changed to filing joint and my refund went up over a hundred dollars. if figuring out the return is as easy as clicking a radio button i think it should be the program's job to find out which is best mathematically, not suggest an option arbitrarily.

the moral is that this was an easy amazon download and a good purchasing experience of a decent program that still has kinks to work out. it gets the job done and i will use it again but with a few minor reservations.",1,software,turbotax get job do matter highly obnoxious flaw reason purchase tt want reenter information last year since use online version repeatedly return similar year year lot frustration learn tt import pdf save previous return create compete software tt get tax file tt online import old data turbotax online idiotically provide file format also reject program time type social birthday try rename file tax2012 file format window assure change file format would probably result destabilization know free world least computer time program accept file business trouble program say file married filing separately would probably best change change file joint refund go hundred dollar figure return easy click radio button think program job find best mathematically suggest option arbitrarily moral easy amazon download good purchasing experience decent program still kink work get job do use minor reservation

"if there had never been a ps3 remote in the past perhaps these review might of been better. but there was and they are not.

when this was announced i was beyond excited. my ps3 had been one of my central media hubs in my home alone with multiple other devices. i used the ps3 for blu-rays, amazon and other streaming services. when the ps4 came alone the simple upgrade in hardware made these services that much more responsive. i waited with baited breath for the newer version of the remote i loved. and waited and waited and waited.

then this remote was announced and i rushed to preorder. counted the days until it arrived. quickly ripped open the box to set it up.
and was quickly disappointed.

there are many things wrong with it but you will see al those in the other review. bad tuner support. bad button placement. doesn't work with every service. issues turning the device on. and i noticed on the play store one simple push down makes the cursor jump multiples spaces. its so light it feels cheap.
had this been called the blu-ray remote it might of been better taken by the public. any positive reviews i think right now were not asking for much, got not a lot and are happy with it. i wanted something as good as what was offered before if not better.

what will i say about this? had i known these facts before i preordered i would not of made this purchase. i'm currently on the fence to returning this. if it was under $10 i could see value. i definitely watch and use more media then i play games so perhaps the ps4 and this bit of junk go in the back room and my trusty ps3 and remote come back out in the living room.

"the user interface is clunky. for example, the ""focus lines"" tool pops up a circle of focus lines with a blue x in the middle. you can move the blue x with your mouse to move the focus lines. if you click just a little bit off from the blue x (which is small), the whole screen moves instead of just the focus lines. the whole time, a ""properties"" dialog is open. you must use the dialog to change any property of the focus lines. a big usability miss - there's no reason why the focus lines couldn't be more interactive with the mouse, pen, computer keyboard, or other more convenient input tools than fiddling with the property window's various drop downs, sliders, buttons, form fields - these things are very mechanical and take me away from my creative mindset.

once you insert an element, be it an ellipse, square, line, whatever - it is no longer sizable or movable. i understand this isn't a vector graphics program, but they could have made the most recent element you add movable and sizable.

this program is targeted at beginners. i fall into that category. i was hoping for something more fun and intuitive to use.

as for the installation problems: i downloaded this using google chrome. i attempted to install, and it just sat there. i gave up for the evening. the next day, i shut down google chrome and the installer launched 4 times. so, there is some poor interaction with file locks or something. the serial number dialog needs 5 different copy & paste operations - this could have been a single copy & paste for the entire serial number. i know it's a niggling point, but there are so many niggling points that they add up to a product that really needs a ui overhaul. finally, installing the ""extra materials"" was difficult - you had to find the right folder on your desktop, and the dialog message that pops up is counter intuitive, and makes you feel like you're installing the wrong thing.

oh, and the extra free content you get for registering the product? boring backgrounds and character poses.

"while the idea of a new doom game made me curl an evil little grin, it also made me wonder if the next installment would be worthwhile.

well, it almost isn't...

to make the first remark positive, the graphics are incredibly stunning.  the way explosions and heat bend the ""air"" around them is one of the most visually impressive effects in any 3d game to date.  the light shadowing is perfect.  the detail on the character animations is very lifelike.  a full length cg movie could be made using the engine from this game.  this is, unfortunately, where the ""wow factor"" ends and where the troubles begin for doom 3.

the system requirements are way off.  i have a brand new dell xps p4 3.4 ghz pc with a ati radeon 9800xt, 1gb of ddr ram and a creative audigy sound card.  on any rez over 1024x768, i experience noticeable frame loss in some areas, with a lower than average fps throughout the whole game.  on a friend of mine's home built pc with a p4 2.0 ghz processor running 512mb of ram and a fairly new nvidia card, the game runs poorly (25 fps) on 640x480 rez.

gameplay is extremely repetitive, where the collection of ""pda's"" (ref. key cards in doom 1 and 2) becomes tantamount in proceeding through the game.  there are too many ""monster bursts from dark room to slay you in a horrible fashion"" encounters for my taste.  the environment's architecture is very box-like, claustrophobic, repetitive, and way too dark.  light is obviously not needed in a place like a mars ground station.

speaking of the environment, the only objects you can interact with are your health boxes, ammo reloads, and some random items that you can kick around.  there are some cleverly scripted control panels, and some mechanical devices operated by said panels, but you have to interact with them to move through the game, they aren't optional.

if you are a fan of the original games, you might notice too that plot outline is the same as the first doom game.  the differences in this story and the original doom game, as one reviewer put it, are almost a direct adaptation of the half-life story (people are trying to make teleportation technology, open portal to a bad place, death ensues).  one nice touch though, is that in doom 3 the scientists have names, and so does the evil ""administrator type person who is out to get everyone"".  oh, and you are fighting demons instead of aliens (they look very much alike, but don't tell them that, they might eat you).

overall, the game tries to build this ""sci-fi horror"" experience, as if you were in a movie like ""event horizon"", but leaves you hitting the quickload button far too many times with ""surprises"" in the dark.  doom 3 is a great techincal game, but suffers from a real lack of originality in plot and environment design.",1,game,idea new doom game make curl evil little grin also make wonder next installment would worthwhile well almost make first remark positive graphic incredibly stun way explosion heat bend air around one visually impressive effect 3d game date light shadow perfect detail character animation lifelike full length cg movie could make use engine game unfortunately wow factor end trouble begin doom 3 system requirement way brand new dell xps p4 34 ghz pc ati radeon 9800xt 1gb ddr ram creative audigy sound card rez 1024x768 experience noticeable frame loss area low average fps throughout whole game friend mine home build pc p4 20 ghz processor run 512mb ram fairly new nvidia card game run poorly 25 fps 640x480 rez gameplay extremely repetitive collection pda ref key card doom 1 2 becomes tantamount proceed game many monster burst dark room slay horrible fashion encounter taste environment architecture boxlike claustrophobic repetitive way dark light obviously need place like mar ground station speak environment object interact health box ammo reloads random item kick around cleverly script control panel mechanical device operate say panel interact move game optional fan original game might notice plot outline first doom game difference story original doom game one reviewer put almost direct adaptation halflife story people try make teleportation technology open portal bad place death ensue one nice touch though doom 3 scientist names evil administrator type person get everyone oh fight demon instead alien look much alike tell might eat overall game try build scifi horror experience movie like event horizon leave hit quickload button far many time surprise dark doom 3 great techincal game suffers real lack originality plot environment design

"using version 7 has been very disappointing, though there is a lot of potential. it makes a lot of stupid mistakes, writing things that make no grammatical sense. surely it would not be difficult to include simple grammatical rules so it can eliminate certain possibilities and have a better chance of correct interpretation. i have to make so many corrections, and the ""select"" function is so unreliable for me that using dragon is usually much slower than typing.

tech support is nonexistent.

now they want us to pay money for version 8. after spending money on the poor quality, buggy product (v7), i'm not sure that i trust this company.

tips: the included headset was not very good. i got better results using my own (cheap) headset, and would probably do better buying a good one.

i can get better results by speaking very clearly and slowly (as if talking to an imbecile) but i very quickly strain my voice. they say to speak normally and clearly without straining, but this just doesn't work - so be careful. look on the internet for a guide to avoiding voice strain.

unfortunately there are no serious alternatives that the moment, so for me it's a choice between voice strain and sore fingers and wrists.

"as most already know twisted metal is a car combat game collect weapons and destroy your enemies as you drive pretty simple idea that can definitely be fun....

summary:(read below if you wanted more info)
1= very good
2=great!
3= hit or miss with the more realistic physics
4= hit or miss imo due to the character design styled more like 1 & 2 than 3
black=first and best ps2 twisted metal arguably the best twisted metal of all
head on=good gameplay online mode included (psp and ps2) spiritual sequel to twisted metal 2
twisted metal (2012 for ps3)=didnt play this one but heard it was good

twisted metal: a great game, revolutionary for video games of the first 3d era. still a fun game and the only twisted metal with the inside the car view no saving to memory cards there was a short code for resuming your game later.

twisted metal 2: most fans will consider this to be the best twisted metal of all the final release with single track after this one the game changes its physics dramatically...

twisted metal 3: in this installment twisted goes for a much more realistic driving feel for the cars. now this isn't necessarily a bad thing but to most fans it just wasn't as fun. this was 989 studios first attempt to make a twisted metal game and fans trying out twisted metal for the first time tend to be the only fans that like 3 the best. however a few of the early twisted metal fans like 3 better but the game play turned off a large percentage of fans so this one is hit or miss try it you might like it best or you might not like it at all.  in the end 989 failure to appeal to a large amount of the fans of the franchise put twisted metals popularity into a downward spiral.

twisted metal 4: this game still made by 989 studios and after twisted metal 3 alot of the people who would of liked this game were no longer interested in twisted metal this one goes back gameplay designed to be fast and fun.  i would say compared to 1 and 2 the default characters you can chose from are less interesting and useful however you can create your own cars.  i think it was this that makes or breaks the game if you found a car you enjoyed playing you would probably like twisted metal 4 if not then your likely to turn away from it and say its a bad game.  this game attempted to incorporate features that would make hands down the best twisted metal and to some it was.  this is the last twisted metal game for the playstation 1.

twisted metal black: first playstation 2 release and back in the hands of the original creators who reformed under the name incognito entertainment.  best graphics easily so far and better than even the game to come after and gameplay thats arguably just or good or better than any of the other games.  with nearly as many features as 4 including the first twisted metal game that was online capable(with a special disc not all copies could do that and official servers are shut down now)  this game is considered the best by playstation 2 fans and many fans of the twisted metal series.

twisted metal head on: this is the spirtual sequel to twisted metal 2 its graphics and gameplay feel like they derived from number 2 however i would not say gameplay is quite as good as number 2 it does have all new stages and solid gameplay with new upgrade system after you kill an opponent you can collect a drop from them to increase your fire power this could be considered better or worse.",1,game,already know twisted metal car combat game collect weapon destroy enemy drive pretty simple idea definitely fun summaryfrown_sad_andry_or_poutingread want info 1= good 2=great 3= hit miss realistic physic 4= hit miss imo due character design style like 1 & 2 3 black=first best ps2 twist metal arguably best twisted metal head on=good gameplay online mode include psp ps2 spiritual sequel twist metal 2 twist metal 2012 ps3=didnt play one heard good twist metal great game revolutionary video game first 3d era still fun game twist metal inside car view save memory card short code resume game later twist metal 2 fan consider best twist metal final release single track one game change physic dramatically twist metal 3 installment twist go much realistic drive feel car necessarily bad thing fan fun 989 studio first attempt make twist metal game fan try twisted metal first time tend fan like 3 best however early twist metal fan like 3 well game play turn large percentage fan one hit miss try might like best might like end 989 failure appeal large amount fan franchise put twisted metal popularity downward spiral twist metal 4 game still make 989 studio twist metal 3 alot people would like game longer interested twist metal one go back gameplay design fast fun would say compare 1 2 default character choose less interesting useful however create car think make break game find car enjoy play would probably like twist metal 4 likely turn away say bad game game attempt incorporate feature would make hand best twist metal last twisted metal game playstation 1 twisted metal black first playstation 2 release back hand original creator reform name incognito entertainment best graphic easily far well even game come gameplay thats arguably good well game nearly many feature 4 include first twist metal game online capablewith special disc copy could official server shut game consider best playstation 2 fan many fan twist metal series twist metal head spirtual sequel twist metal 2 graphic gameplay feel like derive number 2 however would say gameplay quite good number 2 new stage solid gameplay new upgrade system kill opponent collect drop increase fire power could consider good worse

guild wars 2 was presented as a spiritual successor to guild wars 1, set in a more persistent mmo environment instead of the instance-based environment of gw1.  it was supposed to take the design philosophies of the original and improve upon them.  the game, at launched, appeared to be this.  however, a recent patch introduced elements to the game that were specifically said to be excluded from the design.  this element: gear grind.

gw1 stood as a strong game for many years without gear grind.  gear grind serves to gate content, create dead zones within the game, divides the community, and limits accessibility to new players.  it may be ok for those who get on at the ground floor, but i cannot recommend this game to new players.",2,game,preface say guild war 1 veteran guild war 2 present spiritual successor guild war 1 set persistent mmo environment instead instancebased environment gw1 suppose take design philosophy original improve upon game launch appear however recent patch introduce element game specifically say excluded design element gear grind gw1 stand strong game many year without gear grind gear grind serf gate content create dead zone within game divide community limit accessibility new player may ok get ground floor recommend game new player

i reluctantly made the switch to quicken starter edition last year and figured it would be easy since to learn i was already using quickbooks at work.  well it was a rocky & frustrating conversion but i learned to live with it.  i took the opportunity to upgrade to quicken premier 2013 when i was offered a trial through amazon vine.  i was actually pleased at the seamless import of my existing file.  i had no problems whatsoever in that regard.  quicken premier claims it tracks investments, unlike the starter edition, but it didn't work for me.  i was disappointed to find that i still cannot get my ira account data to download.

quicken premier 2013 seems to freeze up less on my system but other than that i honestly can't notice much difference between the premier and starter versions-- for the things i use it for anyway. unless you are having issues with the version you have, i wouldn't rush to upgrade.  if you are using financial software for the first time, make sure you really need all the features of this program because otherwise you're going to spend a lot of time getting it all set up vs. what you're going to gain from it.  if you're looking to manage your investment portfolio- i hope you have better luck getting that function to work than i did.",1,software,use microsoft money decade heartbroken discontinue always work well needetongue_sticking_out_cheeky_playful_or_blowing_a_raspberry consolidated register bank credit card account pc base bill pay platform never use budgeting feature need pie chart tell spend money make reluctantly make switch quicken starter edition last year figure would easy since learn already use quickbooks work well rocky & frustrating conversion learn live take opportunity upgrade quicken premier 2013 offer trial amazon vine actually pleased seamless import exist file problem whatsoever regard quicken premier claim track investment unlike starter edition work disappoint find still get ira account data download quicken premier 2013 seem freeze le system honestly notice much difference premier starter version thing use anyway unless issue version would rush upgrade use financial software first time make sure really need feature program otherwise go spend lot time get set v go gain look manage investment portfolio hope good luck get function work

"i'm a long time se4 player and have been waiting for this to come out for a year now. i should have kept waiting. like previous releases in the series the game has some show-stopping bugs, some of which were addressed in the first post-release patch (though the patch seemed to introduce ai bugs), but these shouldn't be a problem in a few months time (by which time the price will have dropped anyway!)

unfortunately the game has gone in directions that i no longer enjoy so despite my confidence that the game will eventually be playable, it won't be playable in a way i'm going to get a kick out of.

the realtime 3d combat is nasty. i understand that shuffling 2d tiles around a board is very 20th century and everyone is moving to 3d but 2d tiles can look pretty darn good whereas one guy (aaron hall, the man behind the space empires games) coding a game on his own is doing a great job to turn out a 3d system at all but it's not something you're going to show off to anyone. the 3d extends to the map screens so now you can't even see your ships or planets anymore because everything is obscured with floating flags. the ui is pretty customizable and you can even go for a 2d only view but none of it is as clear as the plain old 2d view from se4. there's word this may be put back into the game so reserve judgement on that.

six months or a year from now there will probably be half a dozen mods out and most of the problems will have been sorted out. hopefully.",2,game,long time se4 player wait come year keep wait like previous release series game showstopping bug address first postrelease patch though patch seem introduce ai bug problem month time time price drop anyway unfortunately game go direction longer enjoy despite confidence game eventually playable playable way go get kick realtime 3d combat nasty understand shuffle 2d tile around board 20th century everyone move 3d 2d tile look pretty darn good whereas one guy aaron hall man behind space empire game cod game great job turn 3d system something go show anyone 3d extend map screen even see ship planet anymore everything obscure float flag ui pretty customizable even go 2d view none clear plain old 2d view se4 word may put back game reserve judgement six month year probably half dozen mod problem sort hopefully

"this is a warning to those that are considering purchasing coinmanage.  while the software itself is excellent software, support and coin price updates are now non-existent.  the company's message boards have been taken down, advising that they are checking ""functionality.""  i can only assume that the message boards were removed due to the numerous complaints and unanswered questions that appeared on them.  check the company's (liberty street software) better business bureau rating, and you will see that it is an ""f"" on a scale from a to f.

i have used coinmanage for approx. 8 years, and have most of my numismatic collection entered into the software.  in the past, while coin price updates were not as timely as they should have been, there were two, three, or more updates per year.  now, however, due to the total lack of updates (the last price update was in december of 2009), i am forced to consider other software, such as pro-coin, which means several weeks of re-entering coins into the new software.  if you can live without coin price updates, bullion value updates, and a total lack of support, then this software will probably work well for you - it is good software with a ton of things it can do.  if you require timely coin price updates, etc., which is a major need for most numismatic collectors, stay away from this software.

06-06-2012 edit:  in an effort to be as accurate and as helpful as i can, this is an update to my above post:

first, let me say that i have reread every single review posted here, and if you consider each one subjectively, everyone is basically correct in their own review.  i did read one that brought into question the user's knowledge of the software and how to use it as a possible reason for some of the negative reviews.  this was definitely not the case for me - i am very, very familiar with the software, and have spent well over a thousand hours using it.  i have absolutely no complaints with the software itself, and i'll say it again - for me, the software is excellent software.  it does take some time to learn the software and its features - it has a lot of them!

i am still using the software, and i did purchase the 2011 version subsequent to my review above, hoping that the lack of coin pricing updates, etc., would be resolved with it.  there were some pricing updates.  as of today's date, there have been three price updates since 2009 as follows:  pcgs november 2010, 2011 (regular update, not pcgs), and pcgs march 2012.  so, the software has recieved some pricing updates, not as many as there should have been and that are required in my opinion, but some.  the bullion value updates are working again.  the support forum was back up upon installing the 2011 version, accessed via a new, different hyperlink, but within the last month or two the link is not working again, this time advising a ""template error"". (and yes, i am familiar with the liberty street software's online help button on their website, but i'm talking about the forums in this case.  for actual support for software problems, i do see that someone was able to receive live support via that button.  i have had no need to try to use live support, but as far as i can tell from what i read, problems with that do still exist, and every time i have visited the website live support has been offline)

so, while coin pricing updates still need to be much more frequent, there have been some.  and let's face it - if you are a collector using this software, you are probably a very experienced collector, and no update except real-time would be timely enough as you need an accurate idea of value at the time you are buying/selling anyway.  that said, updates do need to be more frequent.

07-04-2012 edit:

"i got this game on the release date. i am a pes fan who never think to switch to fifa at all.
i had been looking forward to play it for a long time.
i will state the conclusion fist. it is terrible!!! don't buy it yet.

good improvements:
- i am a mlo fan i played it all the timee. pes2014 has a really good point system.
(basically, if you win the one stronger than you, you will get a lot of points.)
- nice stadium graphic design.
- nice main menu screen

bad points!!!:
- online game play is laggy and you will be delayed all the time (95% of 150 games i have played)
- terrible ai especially defenders. i have to admit that i'm not good at defending.
but pes2014 the defender is too stupid, they sometimes just watch the attackers.
sometimes when keeper punched a shot, defenders just do not move and attackers come take a second shot.
- online flaws again, i got 3 disconnected online games in a row. i was winning all 3 games.
they just disconnected with the reason as the network is bad. so the game was cancelled out of record.
sometimes the game just froze, i needed to quit the game to ps menu. it means i lost because i abandoned games.
- slow formation setting. i don't know why they design the new system in formation. the cursor is really slow.
d-pad snap always goes the wrong place.
- cannot use header!!
- slow shot and stupid response
- horrible referee. they are strange. sometimes i just followed the attackers shoulder with shoulder but they gave penalty kicks to my opponent.
sometimes, i was obstructed by opponent defenders without any fouls at all.
- corner kick is harder to score.
- etc.

in conclusion, don't buy it yet!!!
this game made me frustrated a lot.
konami might patch it better around november 2013 but not now.
so far, i give only 1 star.",2,game,get game release date pe fan never think switch fifa look forward play long time state conclusion fist terrible buy yet good improvement mlo fan play time pes2014 really good point system basically win one strong get lot point nice stadium graphic design nice main menu screen bad point online game play laggy delay time 95 % 150 game play terrible ai especially defender admit good defending pes2014 defender stupid sometimes watch attacker sometimes keeper punched shot defender move attacker come take second shot online flaw get 3 disconnected online game row win 3 game disconnect reason network bad game cancel record sometimes game froze need quit game p menu mean lose abandon game slow formation set know design new system formation cursor really slow dpad snap always go wrong place use header slow shot stupid response horrible referee strange sometimes follow attacker shoulder shoulder give penalty kick opponent sometimes obstruct opponent defender without fouls corner kick hard score etc conclusion buy yet game make frustrated lot konami might patch good around november 2013 far give 1 star

2. there are two wire bundles between the top and bottoms halves of the mouse: a three-wire and a four-wire. disconnect the connector for the three-wire bundle by catching the back of the connector with a fingernail and pulling. see picture of separated connector.

"windows 8 ui is the worst i've experienced from an operating system.  the performance is actually really good but the way you have to navigate makes the experience confusing at first.  i used this to bootcamp my macbook and it installed fine.  if you there's any problems installing, partition the disk manually in disk utilities reboot while holding option/alt key, then select not he the newly created partition while the installation disk is inserted, then follow the prompts.  i used this method instead of using bootcamp software because it was giving me problems.  after windows is installed go download the drivers for your system from apple and your set. i believe its called ""bootcamp assistant support""

to solve the horrible ui in win8, i use a shell called ""classic shell"" , which made my life a lot easier.  it creates a start button on your desktop which acts and feels like xp, vista, win7 interfaces. fully customizable.  to be honest it made windows more easier and pleasant to work with.  with the shell, it made win8 an upgrade version of win7.

overall, win8 is not bad once you customize it.  the start tile menu is great for tablets, but for traditional work stations, it's not very functional.  install your own shell and it will make tons of a difference for you.

not wanting to make a transaction over the net (they only accept credit cards on the site!) i had to find a local vendor that sold the software. and thus, the nightmare started. this product isn't easy find. it took me months to find a store that actually sold the dang thing, but when i finally purchased it, i found that it turned out to be version 5.0!!! now, here is where things go horribly wrong...
version 5.0 is a mess. there were multiple times when my palm had to be reset, and there was even an occasion when the document i was working on simply vanished. add to that, there's no such thing as a bookmark even on that older version!

"i used this product win7hpx32, to repair/revive an old dell 2.8ghz tower from 2004 that was still barely running xp and had been hobbling along for almost a full year.  just before the machine was about to give up the ghost i decided to proceed.  as per the win7 advisor which had recommended formatting the hdd (hard disk drive), i did a clean install.  the advisor informed me that my old video card (intel  82865g) was compatible, but that information proved erroneous.  i was able to bypass this failure by increasing my bios video memory setting to the maximum.  it had been previously set at 1mb.  ever since then win7hpx32 has been running flawlessly.  i still have one other machine running the xp (sp3) because a large number of old window and dos applications will not run on win7.

for those of you who don't already know it, xp (sp3) is scheduled to be permanently retired april 8, 2014.  this means no microsoft support of any kind beyond that date.  there will of course be plenty of non-ms support via user community forums, etc., etc..  windows 7 makes everything run so much better.  it is vista... fixed!  it does a much better job of managing whatever memory your machine offers and therefore has way fewer failures.  i have never seen my old dell 2.8ghz with 2gb of memory run so smooth.

if you've been holding off on switching away from xp and you have the option, go ahead and jump in, the water is fine.

the release date for windows 8 has been set for october 2012, three years after the release of its predecessor, windows 7. windows 8's server counterpart, windows server 2012, is in development concurrently with windows 8. the most recent officially released pre-release version is the consumer preview, which was released on february 29, 2012.

see [...]

as i understand it, win 8 reportedly will focus heavily on touch screen features.  i don't see myself jumping into that pool anytime soon.  in fact, i tend to wait a full year after a microsoft os release.  this protocol saved me from the vista os nightmare which i never installed or utilized.  while i wait, i read reviews, tech blogs etc..  my relationship with microsoft goes back to dos 2.2 and i learned long ago not to play guinea pig for microsoft.  windows 7 is fully tested and has established good user rapport for stability.  for the most part, you can trust it.  it is not a perfect os but it is a vast improvement over xp.  if you are upgrading an old machine make certain that you run the win7 advisor... before you purchase.

i just received an email telling me that i'd be automatically billed for another year of service unless i canceled the auto-renewal.  furthermore, they said that i could not cancel any later than 20 days prior to my renewal date, or i'd be billed anyway.

there are numerous complaints from users regarding this practice on message boards maintained by pc tools itself and elsewhere.  if you search for pc tools auto-renewal you will find them.

"voted with my wallet. h&r is 51% off today so after using turbotax to file since 1998, i'm going to give another company my business. not something i want to do mind you, but seriously, nerfing a beloved product is a sure fire way to lose business/trust. i have just a few investments - otherwise, i file a rather bland return. cutting up your product in to more skus than is necessary to mask price increases was foolish and introduced consumer confusion. i would have easily paid a few more bucks if the same product i've bought for nearly half my life was as trustworthy as it was the year before but instead some genius decided gimping a product the majority of their buyers used was a better idea. you really should have left it alone and charged a modest increase. i wouldn't have blinked. i bet most people would have understood that too.

to your beancounters at intuit bob: you don't mess with consistency - that's what equals return business. that very peace of mind before a purchase. that lack of doubt. i was about to blindly pick up deluxe at costco as i typically do but was curious if amazon was cheaper. man, am i glad i did (ouch, that 2 star rating caught my eye instantly!) or i would have had a disappointing realization when working on my taxes and been far more upset than i am now.

"- making the combat system dependent on one-time use stickers was a colossal misstep, especially when some stickers have a very low drop rate, meaning that it's difficult to master certain moves
- kersti (the navi of this game) gives completely useless hints when a puzzle isn't completely obvious. in general, the game and its use of special items (bowling balls, fans, etc.) doesn't attempt to give any sense of hints. if you don't have the right item for a boss, you could be screwed.
- one particular area of the game stretches on forever (world 3). this section seems artificially lengthened to make the game seem substantial.

"siberia 1 was actually the first pc game i had ever played. my brother-in-law thought it would be helpful in keeping me busy during recovery after an extended hospital stay. he was right. he had to help me quite a bit of the way through the 1st one, but i had fun learning from this particular game.

 i asked for siberia 2 as a gift and was excited to play it, as well. i very much enjoyed the graphics of both and liked the fact that i was able to watch ""myself"" as the character, kate walker, rather than being in the first person, as you are in some other games.

 i agree that some of the puzzles had absolutely no logic whatsoever, particularly in the 2nd one. that was quite frustrating. most of the puzzles were fairly logical and with a bit of thought i was able to work through them. there were many times that you had no choice but to back-track in order to accomplish what you had to do, and i found that quite tiresome, as well.

 having said those few negatives comments, however, i loved the story of both of the siberia games and had a lot of fun playing them. they were a great introduction to the pc adventure gaming experience for me, and i'm glad that i was introduced to them.

 i definitely would recommend them to others. they do take some patience, but the story and the graphics really were good, and worth the few spots where you just throw up your hands and have to peek at the ""helps and hints"" so you can continue the joy in the journey! :o)",0,game,siberia 1 actually first pc game ever play brotherinlaw thought would helpful keep busy recovery extend hospital stay right help quite bit way 1st one fun learn particular game ask siberia 2 gift excite play well much enjoy graphic like fact able watch character kate walker rather first person game agree puzzle absolutely logic whatsoever particularly 2nd one quite frustrating puzzle fairly logical bit think able work many time choice backtrack order accomplish find quite tiresome well say negative comment however love story siberia game lot fun play great introduction pc adventure game experience glad introduce definitely would recommend other take patience story graphic really good worth spot throw hand peek help hint continue joy journey happy_face_smiley

"this is the most annoying anti virus i've ever used. will never use anything but mcafee again.

here's the worst part, as life changing as the information makes this sound, you have to download a new app for everything.
want it to clear junk. download an app.
want to see what it's done to protect ypur system. download an app.

this is all in addition, to the download that initiates the ""premium"" protection.
that's the small print they leave out.
it's all included but not on one program. ugh!

oh! the pop ups! granted they are only from norton but it is endless.
i am 2 months into a subscription, which i will not be renewing, and it asks me once a week to renew.
as well, ""would i like to download another app?"" to do what this one told me it would do, ""no, no i would not.""

the only place this excels is on a laptop.
but as this covers 10 devices, i think it's resonable to expect it would not be buggy on a phone or tablet.
if you have ten laptops due to a business or are just a hoarder (no judgement~ we all have our thing),
then this will work wondefully for you.

on my android phone, i did download the 'clean' app. my battery is deplted by the end of day.
my battery was never depleted by end of day prior to norton. now, if i forget to charge at night, my phone it's dead by morning.
the most frustrating part about this is, it's running in the backround so, i can't even control the usage.

then there's the fun little experience of, it shut down my entire ipad os.
three years i've had my ipad. never once had the entire os shut down to the point i had to set up from the beginning.
fun right? oh, yeah..
even more when you forget your password and can't access your email to reset bc it's on the ipad that has been shut down.
thank goodness for the lifewire site or i would have to go be judged by a 'genius'.

the game is made so that a child will not be turned off because he/she cant figure out where to go
prime example:  in the boat, there is a small arrow behind it, that points in the direction you are supose to be traveling in, (see the map you have there is all for show ;p)

  i hung up and called my tech support from my computer manufactuirer who did a total checkout of the machine and found none of the problems that resolv claimed i had.

 anyway the problems i had were simple problems that anyone who has basic pc utilities or knows the utilities that come with windows, can fix in 2 minutes if they existed.

 this was a total rip off.  i ended up talking to a tech support guy who was from lap link who explained that the people who give you online transfer were not really working for laplink..  he said to try to contact laplink directly which is only available by chat.  he was not surprised with the crap i experienced from the resolv person.

they also make it seem that their program requires a special ethernet cable to work through an ethernet connection, one you buy from them.  but the person i talked to who worked for laplink said that any ethernet cable will work.

i was pleasantly surprised on how useful the mouse is outside the context of the game (especially for mac users); it's customizable to the degree that warrants its price.  web-browsing made simpler with the thumb buttons (switch tabs, go back and forward in your history without having to move the mouse around the screen or use keyboard shortcuts). other app ""hot-keys"" can be mapped to buttons, and you have several configurations to save (e.g., i have an ""sc2"" config, a ""web-browsing"" config, etc.)

"it's a shame symantec's security products are among the most used, because it's definately not the best and definately not user-friendly as it seems.

i've recently uninstalled nis 2006, and installed another anti-virus instead. i can't tell you how liberating and freeing it is! my pc seems so much healthier, and quicker doing tasks than it was ever before. programs are running error-free, and i have no problems surfing the internet. none. i trust my new anti-virus more than i ever did with norton. i had this mentality that norton was king, so i would be safe from the dangers of the internet. ""just forgive the problems and keep using norton. they know what they're doing"", i found thinking to myself all the time. i was so wrong. the danger was in choosing and using norton. never again!

norton internet security is a large suite, (which i must say impressed me in the beginning), that's packed full of tools, like anti-spam, intrusion prevention, and security check. but with all these tools monitoring your online activity, you're sometimes literally locked out from using the internet.

by default, many of the tools are turned on, like the pop-up blocker, and ad blocking. most websites have some kind of advertising on them, and norton will see it as adware and blocks the pictures and even the complete site from viewing. websites that launch by using a pop-up window will also get blocked. the intrusion detection feature even blocked quicktime movies from being launched. everything that you might not think is a threat, will be by norton. trusted programs will be deemed as some kind of threat, and blocked. you're sure to encounter many problems and computer slowdown if you don't tweak the settings thoroughly, which is time consuming and frustrating because of all the many settings for each security tool. they're not well explained either, so there might be times when you won't know if what you're changing is going to solve or worsen a problem.

using the anti-virus software wasn't that much better. the full system scan is usually very slow, at least 40 minutes - 1 hour for me every time. it also consumes alot of your computer's resources. i've also noticed that it didn't even scan every file on my hard drive. it didn't detect trojans and spyware (mainly tracking cookies), that other anti-software and spyware programs did. the trojans were causing non stop ads to pop-up on my pc, so i'm very disappointed norton did not find and repair them. i assume norton doesn't believe these trojans/worms and spyware to be a real threat to our security, so they don't include them in searches. i would at least like the option to decide if anything remotely close to a threat, however small it may be, to be included in scans so i can remove them if i want to or not.

the quickscan, which is completed in just a few minutes, scans ""areas most likely to be infected"", like the memory and running processes in the background. although quick, it is usually unreliable when searching for deeply embedded viruses, worms, and spyware.

the norton protection center is a nice notification system where you can review all the problems norton detects, and suggests you should fix. it's a nice feature, but the pop-ups can get very annoying, especially when there is no real threat involved.

one only thing i really liked from nis 2006 is it's firewall. nothing that connects to the internet, incoming or outgoing, is done so without your permission. when a program is trying to access the internet, norton gives you the choices of allowing it once, allowing always, block, block always, and automatic. i find the ""block this instance"" very useful, since i might not want to block a program fully, but just one time from accessing the internet. the firewall is a very useful tool, but beware of turning on the ""program learning"" feature. i set that off and manually decide which programs have access, because the feature might block something you use regularly and not tell you it did, so you'll might have problems and might not know the firewall caused it.

there are other tools i haven't mentioned, but those i have found, were not used much by me. and probably not by you too, because they're not really as neccessary as the firewall and anti-virus are.

the updates are very plentiful. there is always at least one update every few days. but once your subscription expires, they stop, and you're on your own. renewal is very pricey too, something i believe is not worth it.

many people complain about it, but i haven't encountered any problems i couldn't solve myself, so i have yet to contact the customer service department. if you're an experienced user, i doubt you'll have to contact them either.

though not as slow as other security software available, norton does slow down your computer. even with my high speed pc, i've definately noticed the slowdown before and after installation. even using internet explorer has seemed slower, and especially at your computer's start-up is where you notice it the most. the slowdown is not very significant, but i wouldn't complain if the slowdown was un-noticeable, which it is.

if these problems are not bad enough, the worst problem of all was that i found my pc freezing constantly. programs that worked trouble-free began to have problems when opened. aim would freeze when i was signed on, and i could never get it to restart except to wait for the next time i would turn on the computer. the taskbar would freeze too, causing the applications installed on it to relaunch. even when opening ""my computer"" and browsing through my files, the browser would freeze unexpectedly. at shutdown or while logging off, there often times would be a program named ""ccapp.exe"" that wouldn't shut down by itself, so i had to do it manually, or wait for it to do it itself, which would take a very long time. before i had installed nis 2006, a program that froze never caused the entire computer to freeze. never, not once. windows xp was designed not to do that. but guess what? it did after i installed nis.

well, there you have it. my review and my nis 2006 experience. take my opinion and choose a different security suite. if you're stuck with it for the moment, stick with it. don't waste your money, the software won't be fatal to use. but the problems it causes is just ridiculous, so jump ship as soon as you can.",2,software,shame symantec security product among use definately best definately userfriendly seem recently uninstalled ni 2006 instal another antivirus instead tell liberate freeing pc seem much healthy quicker task ever program run errorfree problem surf internet none trust new antivirus ever norton mentality norton king would safe danger internet forgive problem keep use norton know find thinking time wrong danger choose use norton never norton internet security large suite must say impressed beginning pack full tool like antispam intrusion prevention security check tool monitor online activity sometimes literally lock use internet default many tool turn like popup blocker ad block website kind advertising norton see adware block picture even complete site view website launch use popup window also get blocked intrusion detection feature even block quicktime movie launch everything might think threat norton trust program deem kind threat block sure encounter many problem computer slowdown tweak setting thoroughly time consume frustrate many setting security tool well explain either might time know change go solve worsen problem use antivirus software much well full system scan usually slow least 40 minute 1 hour every time also consume alot computer resource also notice even scan every file hard drive detect trojan spyware mainly track cooky antisoftware spyware program trojan cause non stop ad popup pc disappointed norton find repair assume norton believe trojansworms spyware real threat security include search would least like option decide anything remotely close threat however small may include scan remove want quickscan complete minute scan area likely infect like memory run process background although quick usually unreliable search deeply embed virus worm spyware norton protection center nice notification system review problem norton detects suggest fix nice feature popups get annoy especially real threat involve one thing really like nis 2006 firewall nothing connects internet incoming outgo do without permission program try access internet norton give choice allow allow always block block always automatic find block instance useful since might want block program fully one time access internet firewall useful tool beware turn program learning feature set manually decide program access feature might block something use regularly tell might problem might know firewall caused tool mention found use much probably really neccessary firewall antivirus update plentiful always least one update every day subscription expire stop renewal pricey something believe worth many people complain encountered problem could solve yet contact customer service department experience user doubt contact either though slow security software available norton slow computer even high speed pc definately notice slowdown installation even use internet explorer seem slow especially computer startup notice slowdown significant would complain slowdown unnoticeable problem bad enough bad problem find pc freeze constantly program work troublefree begin problem open aim would freeze sign could never get restart except wait next time would turn computer taskbar would freeze cause application instal relaunch even open computer browse file browser would freeze unexpectedly shutdown logging often time would program name ccappexe would shut manually wait would take long time instal nis 2006 program froze never cause entire computer freeze never windows xp design guess instal nis well review nis 2006 experience take opinion choose different security suite stick moment stick waste money software fatal use problem cause ridiculous jump ship soon

"windowsxp was one of the most anticipated upgrades in computer history, but much like many other things microsoft related, this product has proven to be more trouble than it is help.
there's alot of good to be said about xp pro. bootup times are much quicker than any other ms operating system, better user management than windows 2000, and lots of compatability. my favorite feature has to be the automatic recognition of plug-n-play devices, which has served as a life saver in quick situations. for those who like a pc with a nice interface, xp has unlimited skinning properties, which is good. but they take up extra ram, which is bad. crashes are also down as well, which is good.
xp pro has a ton of features that come automatically enabled. i can't list how many of these i've just turned off because they just plain didn't serve a purpose or were an annoyance. the ip addresser of the windows xp messenger has become a haven for spammers. the ""services"" that windows automatically enables do nothing more than take up ram and slow you down. the system restore will eat a big chunk of your pc if you don't know how to turn it down/off. the cd burning feature is tricky and pointless. i see no reason why you would use this over a commerical product such as nero (or even a free cd burning program, such as burn at once).
this is all not mentioning the numerous security holes in the operating system. microsoft tries to fix this my automatically running windows update while you're online. if you have a fast pc and broadband, then you might not notice it going. but if you're on an older pc or have dial-up, then it will cut into your internet speeds and processor speeds. if you turn it off, then you have to remember to check it on your own.
i also can't count the numer of times i've gotten phone calls asking me how to put my computer and my documents back on the desktop, since they're hidden by default.

the real issue for me, (and it was a beauty), was that it would not open my old quicken 2006 files. i'm not a nerd, okay, (and i mean no disrespect to those of you who are), but i'm one of those who likes to open the old files with my new software and have them automatically convert to the new version. no can do with this upgrade.  first you have to go back and manually ""convert"" your old quicken 2006 files. then you have to import into the new quicken. easy, i'm sure, if you are the aforementioned nerd, but for the rest of us, well, let's just say it wasn't that easy (or pretty).  thank goodness i had a very patient tech support guy on the other end of the chat window, but it was a real hassle, to put it mildly, by the time i finally got through with it i was ready for an adult beverage.

my advice: if you are upgrading from quicken 2006, the best time to do it would be at the same time you have opened up a new bank account. that way you can avoid the headache of trying to convert and import your old quicken 2006 files. but once it's done, and once you get used to the new platform, it's really not a bad little piece of software.  at least in my humble opinion.",1,software,really postponed buying upgrade recently buy new mac much choice newer operating system run quicken 2006 way like new version well streamline make reconcile checkbook little easy real issue beauty would open old quicken 2006 file nerd okay mean disrespect one like open old file new software automatically convert new version upgrade first go back manually convert old quicken 2006 file import new quicken easy sure aforementioned nerd rest u well let say easy pretty thank goodness patient tech support guy end chat window real hassle put mildly time finally get ready adult beverage advice upgrade quicken 2006 best time would time open new bank account way avoid headache try convert import old quicken 2006 file do get use new platform really bad little piece software least humble opinion

it is also damn near impossible to upgrade from the student license of this issue to the full license of the next issue.  which means the next time i want to upgrade i have to purchase a full license all over again.

i guess we will use a ledger book and pencil while traveling

unfortunately the quicken deluxe 2014 is, for us, a big step backward from the 2008 release.  fortunately i saved the 2008 qdata file and have a disk to re install q 2008.

"so i ordered one of these because like many i have n64 controllers with worn sticks. this product is advertised as a ""gamecube style"" replacement stick, with reviews and a picture that support this claim. this is not what i received. the part i got is unarguably the n64 style control stick, albeit with possibly higher strength plastic. i wasn't planning on abusing it long enough to know for sure. i was planning on buying five more from this seller if this one met expectations, but now i'm not so sure.

the part went in easy enough. some unscrewing to remove the back of the controller, a few more screws and moving a couple of wires to remove the old control stick unit, replace it with the new stick unit, put everything back together and you're good to go. it seems to work fine, at least with the games i tried it with, but it feels slightly stiff. maybe it's just me.

i have just ride the learning curve to fix a problem that is current as of july 2013 and that apparently microsoft would not acknowledge as a bug. let me explain:
1) upgrade process goes through nicely. no problem at all.
2) once upgraded, user finds that the remote desktop configuration is greyed out and there aren't any remote desktop groups in the computer management panel (under users and groups). this is a huge problem because many of us purchasing the pro pack are doing it precisely to be able to connect remotely to the computer.

4) there is a 'fix' that re-creates the groups as pro should have them from the beginning. please read: [...]

i'm a gamer/computer user, and i always used to have problems with bloodshot eyes.
i did not need glasses, and just wanted to get rid of this problem. my parents would always comment on my eyes, and said i played way too many games and needed to be ""nicer to my eyes"".
i got these, and so far they have worked fantastically. my eyes are no longer bloodshot at the end of the day. i can tell a huge difference.
if i look at a screen for a while with the glasses on, and then take them off, the screen looks significantly more blue then i would notice before. my eyes adjust within a minute, but it certainly shows the contrast.

"i am a long time quicken pc user who switched several months ago to quicken essentials for the mac.  it is much better than all the crappy reviews you read on amazon.  i will preface my review by stating that i do not use quicken to track my stock/bond investment transactions.  i do track my portfolio values by downloading the values, but i track the buying/selling details in my brokerage online account and in an excel spreadsheet (much easier and better in my opinion).

i started using quicken pc in 1998 and upgraded to quicken 2003 and then 2007 over the years.  love the pc version.  was very reluctant to switch to the new mac version after reading all the bad reviews.  i am glad i made the switch.  i waited to write this review until i had used it for several months.

conversion of files:  i had to upgrade to quicken 2007 before i could transfer my data to quicken mac.  bought an old version of quicken 2007 off ebay for $10.  the conversion went fine.  i did have to go in and clean up some data files, but i had over 10 years of data so that was not unexpected.

pros:
1.  like the 1 line listing.  didn't at first but found it to be much better the more i use it.
2.  like being able to easily move transactions from one account to the other by dragging them over.  gives me a true mac experience.
3.  love being able to download transactions which i never did in the pc version.  i rarely have download issues and the ones i have are insignificant.  really like that i can catch transactions that my wife did when she forgets to give me her transaction receipt.
4.  love being able to download my asset values 0 -- savings accounts, brokerage accounts -- to get a daily update.  works great.
5.  like the ability to see a quick overall picture of my assets including checking accounts and credit cards.
6.  find that entering transactions is quick and easy.
7.  reconciling my checking account each month now takes 5 minutes while it used to take 30-45 minutes.  great time saver!
8.  like the register showing future transaction dimmed out so i can review & mark them paid when it occurs.
9.  the mac version is easy to use and i really prefer it over the pc versions i used for 13 years.

cons:
1.  i wish i could integrate tracking my mortgage liabilities into my checking account.  i still have not figured out how to reflect mortgage payments separately (principal & interest) so it automatically updates my mortgage liability account.....deducting the principal portion of the mortgage payment.  i now go back in manually each month to enter the principal part into the mortgage liability account.  not a big deal but i would prefer it to happen automatically when the mortgage payment hits the checking account in quicken.
2.  the budget feature is not the easiest to use.  i find it a bit tedious and not real flexible.  it is ok once it is set up.
3.  the quickfill feature needs some improvement.  it can get a bit slow as it goes through my 13 year data history finding matches.  and i don't like when it automatically pulls in previous data to populate a multi-category transaction.  not sure if there is a better way to do this.

overall:  really glad i made the switch to the mac version so i could stop using my old pc.  now i can do all of my computer work on a single computer and not have to keep my pc connected so i could still do quicken.  for those on the fence, give it a try for a month or two and i think you will be glad you did.",0,software,long time quicken pc user switch several month ago quicken essential mac much good crappy review read amazon preface review state use quicken track stockbond investment transaction track portfolio value download value track buyingselling detail brokerage online account excel spreadsheet much easy good opinion start use quicken pc 1998 upgrade quicken 2003 2007 year love pc version reluctant switch new mac version read bad review glad make switch wait write review use several month conversion file upgrade quicken 2007 could transfer data quicken mac buy old version quicken 2007 ebay $ 10 conversion go fine go clean data file 10 year data unexpected pro 1 like 1 line listing first find much good use 2 like able easily move transaction one account drag give true mac experience 3 love able download transaction never pc version rarely download issue one insignificant really like catch transaction wife forgets give transaction receipt 4 love able download asset value 0 saving account brokerage account get daily update work great 5 like ability see quick overall picture asset include check account credit card 6 find entering transaction quick easy 7 reconcile check account month take 5 minute use take 3045 minute great time saver 8 like register show future transaction dim review & mark pay occur 9 mac version easy use really prefer pc version use 13 year con 1 wish could integrate tracking mortgage liability check account still figure reflect mortgage payment separately principal & interest automatically updates mortgage liability accountdeducting principal portion mortgage payment go back manually month enter principal part mortgage liability account big deal would prefer happen automatically mortgage payment hit check account quicken 2 budget feature easy use find bit tedious real flexible ok set 3 quickfill feature need improvement get bit slow go 13 year data history find match like automatically pull previous data populate multicategory transaction sure well way overall really glad make switch mac version could stop use old pc computer work single computer keep pc connect could still quicken fence give try month two think glad

"i ordered this product off amazon almost a year ago.  overall, i am pleased with it.  as far as making my ps4 portable and easily transportable, my options were very limited.  short of spending over $1,000 for one of those custom ""laptop"" ps4's or lugging around my ps4 and a monitor separately, this was my only choice.  i have a good job that allows me to bring my console to work and play during slow times a few days a week, so i am constantly bringing this product back and forth from work and home.  now, i've read complaints about the picture not actually being 1080, but personally i have no complaints there.  the screen has been just fine for me.  the sound is excellent as well.  the product does a good job of securing your console, which is very important.

now to the issues i have with it, and there are quite a few.  first, when i eject a disc from my ps4, the disk actually runs right into the bottom lip of the case.  i have to basically pull up on my ps4 as i eject a disc just so there is enough clearance for the disc to get out all the way.  i use the included pad for underneath the ps4, but it doesn't provide enough clearance.  another problem area is the latches.  when you close the device, there is no way to really lock it into place.  i've had a latch pop open several times.  i ordered some luggage locks online but when i used them the opening in the latch was so big that the lock went right through it, making it useless.  i'll have to get bigger locks, but i shouldn't have to lock the thing every time just to keep it from accidentally opening.  the most annoying feature is the shoulder strap that comes with it.  it is constantly coming detached from the case.  the little pieces that it snaps into are next to useless.  half the time that i pick it up by the strap, one of them pops off.  this is a disaster waiting to happen.  i wish they would do something to address this.  the other pain in the rear end is if you happen to turn your console on before you turn the monitor on, it won't connect.  i don't know why this is and i don't know why it wasn't addressed before this product was even put on the market, but it's annoying and it requires you to shut everything down and turn it back on in the proper order.

if i had to do it over again, i would probably just buy the hd monitor that gaems sells and throw that and the console into some type of laptop computer bag.",1,game,ordered product amazon almost year ago overall pleased far make ps4 portable easily transportable option limit short spending $ 1000 one custom laptop ps4 lug around ps4 monitor separately choice good job allows bring console work play slow time day week constantly bring product back forth work home read complaint picture actually 1080 personally complaint screen fine sound excellent well product good job secure console important issue quite first eject disc ps4 disk actually run right bottom lip case basically pull ps4 eject disc enough clearance disc get way use include pad underneath ps4 provide enough clearance another problem area latch close device way really lock place latch pop open several time order luggage lock online use opening latch big lock go right make useless get big lock lock thing every time keep accidentally open annoy feature shoulder strap come constantly come detach case little piece snap next useless half time pick strap one pop disaster wait happen wish would something address pain rear end happen turn console turn monitor connect know know addressed product even put market annoy require shut everything turn back proper order would probably buy hd monitor gaems sell throw console type laptop computer bag

the retractable mic doesn't expand far enough in front of the mouth.
the earmuffs are some sort of cheap cloth and won't last long. i think that is why they include a second black set.

dealing with steelseries has been a pain! i told them the problems and said i wanted a full refund + shipping and they sent me a list of things i needed to do for a rma. one being a copy of the sales receipt (as if hoping i didn't save a copy), which i do have. sad thing is, it's only been a week and i know they have a copy of the sales as well as i do.
the emails have been fast between the 2 of us until i mentioned that i wanted to send them back today. lo and behold, i haven't heard back from them since i said that.
after filling ""their"" requirements, i'm still waiting for an rma.
after sending them an email saying the headset doesn't work, they replied saying, ""sounds like a problem with the micro sub connection to the headset"" and after doing a lot of research, found out they've had problems with the right side headsets on many headsets for over a year!!
they know of a problem with the headsets but continue to sell them anyway.

"i have been using the garmin us topo series for years. wish i had switched to the 24k topo series long ago.

i am using the product with a garmin hcx. the biggest advantage is it supports auto routing, which the other garmin software cannot.  this feature alone makes it worth the price. it has settings capability to follow roads, paths, etc. that you need to adjust depending on your planned use.  i have used it for hiking, and as a auto gsp.

i also like the ability to quickly change routs.  if the calculagted route needs minor modification, you can ""drag"" the route with the pointer tool to the preferred road/path, and the software recalculated the route.

other unexpected advatages are the inclusion of many busnesses, government, public sites and addresses, all of which can be searched for. i do not know how often these are updated, but i used the feature to find resturants in oregon on a recent trip. basically, in the city, it is like having a full blown car gps mapping software.  yet, when in the field, with the proper defaults set on your computer and gps, it will select hiking or biking paths.

the down sides are poor instructions (need to learn it's capability via trial and error).
routs set up on a computer and transfered to a gps may not be the same.  the reason for the discrepancies is if the routing preferences on the computer and the gps are not the same, the gsp will recalculate the route.",0,software,use garmin u topo series year wish switch 24k topo series long ago use product garmin hcx big advantage support auto rout garmin software feature alone make worth price setting capability follow road path etc need adjust depend plan use use hike auto gsp also like ability quickly change rout calculagted route need minor modification drag route pointer tool prefer roadpath software recalculate route unexpected advatages inclusion many bus government public sit address search know often update used feature find resturants oregon recent trip basically city like full blown car gps mapping software yet field proper default set computer gps select hike bike path side poor instruction need learn capability via trial error rout set computer transfer gps may reason discrepancy rout preference computer gps gsp recalculate route

"for the past 15-20 years, i periodically purchase whatever version of dragon naturally speaking is out.  each time it is so-so, and i end up not using it regularly.  this one is no different.  frankly, i barely can discern a difference between the first one of these i bought maybe 15 years ago the current one.  my computer has sufficient power, but there is repeated and endless lag with this product.  if you see the little flame near your cursor, it's good to go, and it types out your words pretty well (in word).  however, after what seems like each sentence, the flame disappears.  you can still dictate, but nothing is happening on the screen.  there can be like a 30 second lag before the words show up.  so you cannot quickly dictate something, edit quickly or switch to a different screen (if you switch to a different screen while waiting, when the program eventually types your words it will put them on whatever screen you're on).  you have to wait and wait and wait.  it's annoying and unproductive.  it works okay in word and outlook email, but it completely sucks in adobe acrobat.  it also won't ""learn"" special typing things well or easily.  for example, getting it to recognize a case cite like 37 s.w.2d 425, forget about it.  also, it has texts you can read for it to ""learn"" your voice.  why do these all have to be 30-45 minute dictation sessions?  just give us some short samples.

the best use for this product, for me, is when i am reading something and wanting to type down notes or a summary.  it's pretty good for that, to remain hands-free.  or at the end of the day, if i'm tired and want to lean back in my chair instead of being hunched over a keyboard, it can be used to slowly create or edit a document.

"i pre-ordered this game fairly early and i was very excited to get home from work on release day to try it. unfortunately, within a couple hours of playing i was rather disappointed.

don't get me wrong, it's not a bad game. it's just not as good as the hype made it out to be (nor is it nearly as good as it obviously has the potential to be). the game play is easy to learn and is very fluid. however, each match feels incredibly similar to every other match. you start on foot, you shoot a few guys, you get in your titan and shoot a few guys, then your titan blows up and you start the process over. i know this is the basic format of an fps, but for some reason this game quickly felt stale.

the ""campaign"" mode is basically 5 death matches and 3 rounds of domination. there is a minimal storyline but it doesn't really affect or tie into the gameplay very much. the ""classic"" mode (i.e. traditional multiplayer mode) is a little more entertaining. it includes capture the flag (which was my favorite game mode) and a titan hunt mode. after playing with my friends for a few rounds, we were fairly bored and a couple guys switched over to playing battlefield 4.

i think the thing that disappoints me most is that this game has the potential to be so much more. the mech warrior format offers a great platform and the story could have been amazing. if nothing else, the multiplayer should at least be more dynamic. maybe future patches and dlc will improve the experience. time will tell.

the tl;dr summary: don't have too high of hopes if you buy this game, and i would recommend waiting for a price drop before purchasing.",1,game,preordered game fairly early excited get home work release day try unfortunately within couple hour play rather disappointed get wrong bad game good hype make nearly good obviously potential game play easy learn fluid however match feel incredibly similar every match start foot shoot guy get titan shoot guy titan blow start process know basic format fps reason game quickly felt stale campaign mode basically 5 death match 3 round domination minimal storyline really affect tie gameplay much classic mode ie traditional multiplayer mode little entertaining include capture flag favorite game mode titan hunt mode play friend round fairly bored couple guy switch play battlefield 4 think thing disappoints game potential much mech warrior format offer great platform story could amaze nothing els multiplayer least dynamic maybe future patch dlc improve experience time tell tldr summary high hope buy game would recommend wait price drop purchasing

"have been a fan of the anno series for a while, and still regularly play 1701 & 1404. however the moronic decision by ubisoft to impose this ""always-on"" drm scheme has made anno 2070 the most difficult game to deal with out of the hundreds i own. it seems aaa publishers are out to kill pc gaming in favor of consoles, because i can honestly think of no other reason a company would willingly subject paying customers to these kind of headaches. recently ubisoft's servers went down for a lengthy period making anno 2070 and several other newer titles unplayable during that time.

i purchased the game on day one of that downtime (anno 2070 was not supposed to be affected), meaning no access to a game i had just payed for. the game itself is basically what one would expect if you are familiar with the anno series, except instead of taking place in a historical setting, we are propelled to a ""hard"" science fiction world. the change of pace is nice, graphics and gameplay are top-notch. in short, it continues the anno tradition admirably.

however, when taking into account the always-on drm, the need to create a ""u-play"" account (on top of steam), and the massive amount of fail due to the server transfer and subsequent downtime, i cannot see why anyone would want to pay $50 to subject themselves to the hassle. it is time companies stopped treating their paying customers as potential criminals. no other industry is so invasive in terms of restricting access to a paid product than pc gaming and aaa publishers, and even with ea's recent move to the annoying exclusivity and heavy handed origin, ubisoft takes the proverbial cake when it comes to making you jump through hoops just to play a game you paid good money for.

for myself, anno 2070 will be the last ubisoft title i will be purchasing, unless the company stops treating its paying customers so poorly.

yes, the camera function for the coasters and rides is wonderful.  also love the new selection of thrill rides.

also appreciate the ""autofinish"" for designing coasters, so i don't have to spend an hour trying to get the end of the track to line up with the station.

ride extras like volcanos and sharks jumping out of water...fantastic.

and, getting down to eye level and looking at your park is just a thrilling experience.

needs improvement:

moving around the park and zooming in is a pain in the *@!.  yes, i figured it out, but i hate it.  it is a chore.

the scenarios are ludicrous.  the sandbox mode is the only way to go here.

the employees don't do their jobs, need training, have to be fired, etc.  and drink stands and food stalls break down.  i did not buy rollercoaster tycoon to learn to be a human resources manager.  i want to play with an amusement park.  this aspect of the game is largely a nuisance.

fireworks...nice, but i'd rather have more rides.

you can't make tunnels!

love the night scenes, but you cant put lights in the coasters, so they are just these dark blobs in the middle of the park.

in all, the sandbox mode will keep you occupied.  but after playing a few times i'm fairly bored with the game.  it's radically different from the previous games in spirit and execution, and will really take some getting used to.  i'm just not feeling that urge to play with it again.",1,game,good stuff yes camera function coaster rid wonderful also love new selection thrill rid also appreciate autofinish design coaster spend hour try get end track line station ride extra like volcano shark jump waterfantastic get eye level look park thrill experience need improvement move around park zoom pain * @ yes figure hate chore scenario ludicrous sandbox mode way go employee job need train fire etc drink stand food stall break buy rollercoaster tycoon learn human resource manager want play amusement park aspect game largely nuisance fireworksnice would rather rid make tunnel love night scene cant put light coaster dark blob middle park sandbox mode keep occupied play time fairly bored game radically different previous game spirit execution really take get use feeling urge play

"i bought fluenz spanish 1 and 2 after reading many positive reviews. however overall i would rate this program as average.

some of the lessons are quite good. you will get plenty of reinforcement in each lesson with matching and written exercises. and they've really tried hard to make it interesting with the graphics and varied exercises.

however sometimes the execution isn't very good. the written exercises can sometimes be frustrating because it will tell you something is wrong when what you've written out is correct.

also, a few of the conversations used as the basis for the lessons are disjointed and at times seem like random thoughts just thrown out. you get to the end of some of these conversations and think, what was that?

another disappointing thing is that the navigation in each lesson goes only one way -- forward. you want to go back to a previous frame or another part of the lesson? or start back where you left off in the lesson? forget it. you have to start back and the beginning and click next until you get to where you want. if they did usability testing it doesn't show.

finally, the podcasts are dreadful. if you've heard them you know what i mean. the audio tracks from the cd are too short and not worthwhile.

"i purchased & installed this version in early november, 2012. i have used quicken products for more then 20 years with no complaints....until now. in early december, 2012 i ran the 'r10' update. since then i have not been able to connect to any of my banks, credit cards, etc to do the online update through quicken (which i've also used for years). so i started trying to get help from quicken support. i called & they had no solution for me, so they 'escalated' my case and had me upload my log files.

in a couple of days, i received a ""canned response"" email telling me to reset my bank passwords, inactivate & deactivate my accounts in quicken, add new accts, etc. none of these standard answers work!! i had already tried them all numerous times during my phone conversation and once i deactivated any account online, i was not able to reactivate it at all! so i called again, was put on hold for 25 minutes and then disconnected because their office had closed.

so i tried the online chat. he tried to help, but nothing worked, so he had me submit my log files again and 'escalated' my case, again. in a couple of days i received a ""canned response"" email again telling me to try all the things i had already tried if none of that worked, i should open a case and submit my log files! so far, i've also received 3 emails thanking me for contacting quicken customer support and ""hoping that they had resolved my problem satisfactorily"". ha... i responded to each but no results.

i have several emails, 3 phone calls & 2 online chats and have uploaded my log files 5 times, with no results, just get sent round & round in the same circle. yesterday i sent another email responding to their most recent 'canned response' and lack of service and i insisted that i be given contact information for a manager or supervisor. today, i received yet another email from customer service. this one said it was from ""ashish canan"", (who supposedly is a floor manager) saying he/she (?) had gone through the complete incident and log files which i had uploaded. ashish was able to see the error code cc 899, which was clearly the problem, in the log files. then ashish told me to ""please follow the steps mentioned in the following link: blah, blah, blah"" which was exactly what all the rest had told me to do....obviously reading through my entire incident file helped them a lot!

then ashish followed up with this statement, almost as an after-thought: ""i also wish to inform you that cc-899 is an known issue and our team is working on the issue. if the issue is not resolved by following the steps then please signup for the notification. when the issue will be resolved then you will get the notification from us.""

"they'll work for a quick fix, but they're better ornaments for your fish tank than controllers. both of them broke in a matter of weeks. they didn't just stop working, though. they gradually lost functionality, began to rattle from inside when the rumble kicked in, and the buttons and triggers had more and more give with each passing day.
first to go was the l button. probably because i play so much eternal darkness, and l is the sprint button. zombies will actually grab you in hordes and eat your face off in that game if you don't move quickly. so much for saving the earth if i can't even walk fast!
then was the c stick. the c stick is a silent superhero, an underrated necessity that is taken for granted far too often. losing the c stick meant no longer being able to open the inventory in starfox. i could no longer conduct in wind waker. worst of all, and leaving me with a heavy heart, i could not direct my group of pikmin away from a pack of spotted bullybears, and i could only run with all of them following behind in a loose trail as the spotted bullybears caught up... countless men were lost that day.
never forget the great pikmin massacre of 2k16.
never forget.
and then, of course, the control stick suddenly became loose. the functionality following that lingered for a few hours until it disjointed itself from the inside, like an internal decapitation, and i could not turn right anymore, leaving vanessa z schneider of p.n.03 at the mercy of the cams facility robots since turning 345 degrees left is much slower than just turning 15 degrees right. then, that poor orange beast, crash bandicoot, got killed by the most pathetic enemy in the entire  wrath of cortex game, a little bat that flies in circles farting fairy dust wherever it goes.
my dignity has died. my life is in shambles. if they had simply stopped working, it would have been fine. but instead they degraded themselves and took me with them.

the horns are made of a light weight foam which is great if you plan on wearing them for a long period of time. wore them for servers hours at a ren fair and didn't notice i was wearing them half the time.

the cons to this is i felt like these are priced a bit to high for the quality you receive. don't get me wrong these are fantastic and look great but it's honestly just foam. tad expensive in my opinion.

also the horns are threded with a clear plastic adjustable band that kinda take away from the costume. they where very hard to hide and i have thicker hair. i ended up wearing a flowercrown over the band to try and hid them but even in photos i got back back i could still see the band in some angles.

if you have the time and supplies, which i didn't have at the time, i would highly suggest cutting the cord off and glueing clips to the horns and fastening them in that way. it would look a lot better on and you wouldn't have to struggle with trying to hide the cord every 15 minutes.",1,fashion,& nbspthese horn perfect look find lot horn list amazon spiral one tight make sense go ram look ren fair horn make light weight foam great plan wear long period time wear server hour ren fair notice wear half time con felt like price bit high quality receive get wrong fantastic look great honestly foam tad expensive opinion also horn threded clear plastic adjustable band kinda take away costume hard hide thicker hair end wear flowercrown band try hide even photo get back back could still see band angle time supply time would highly suggest cut cord glue clip horn fasten way would look lot well would struggle try hide cord every 15 minute

when you boot up, it also takes a while for it to scan stuff (no clue what) and your system is sluggish for 15min or so.  i've got a fairly fast system (scsi drive and dual athlon) so it shouldn't feel this slow.  i asked them if there was anything else i could turn off besides setting it to scan new/updated files but they didn't know what features ate up the most time (you'd think they'd benchmark each of their features to see which ones they should tune up).

it also locks your web site directories (the ones under wwwroot) if you do any development, so to delete one of those directories, you have to pause kav.

i'm worried that a kav update will render my system unbootable but i image my windows partition frequently enough that i can uninstall it if it comes to that point.  at least it ties up your system less than norton antivirus when it does a full system scan.  if i didn't pay for this, i'd just use the freebie avast or antivir which are much less resource intensive :-p",1,software,buy one far deal try highly rat kav bummed system would reboot win2k instal lot back forth w want run getsysteminfo finally manage download update instal install properly boot also take scan stuff clue system sluggish 15min get fairly fast system scsi drive dual athlon feel slow ask anything els could turn besides set scan newupdated file know feature ate time would think would benchmark feature see one tune also lock web site directory one wwwroot development delete one directories pause kav worry kav update render system unbootable image windows partition frequently enough uninstall come point least tie system less norton antivirus full system scan pay would use freebie avast antivir much less resource intensive p

"after playing the first buffy game countless times (and enjoying it each time), my anticipation for chaos bleeds was high, especially when i learned that the game mechanics of the sequel were supposed to be similar to the first game.  unfortunately, that anticipation has turned to moderate disappointment.  chaos bleeds is a step backwards for the buffy game franchise.
the seattle reviewer below gave a pretty thorough and on-the-mark review of the game.  the camera, even if you invert the horizontal and vertical via the options menu, is still a frustrating obstacle.  many vamps, zombies, werewolves and other creepy crawlies will get in many sucker punches simply because the camera will not cooperate in time for you to defend or attack.  even worse, the combat mechanics don't seem as slick as the first game's.  it's an ordeal executing moves in this game when you've got 2-3 baddies taking whacks at you all at once.  the addition of a block button and the sidestep feature is nice, but not enough to overcome the problems with the fighting mechanics.
the graphics are a noticeable improvement over the first game, much sharper and the colors are more vibrant.  however, pick-up items are a nightmare to locate at times because of the lighting.  the characters resemble their flesh-and-blood counterparts pretty well, with the possible exception of xander.  and yes, willow and anya's voices are terrible -- especially willow's.  the actress that provides buffy's voice is the same from the first game (jennifer hale) and she's spot on -- you'd swear it's smg.

"first thing first, if this were a review for ""symphony of the night,"" and ""symphony of the night"" only, there would be 5 shiny gold stars at the top. however, this is a review for ""the dracula x chronicles,"" the largest part of which is the remake of ""rondo of blood""--thus: 1 star for including ""sotn"" as bonus content (you'll have to beat ""rondo"" to play ""symphony""), and 2 stars for ""rondo of blood.""
now i know that such a rating will border on blasphemy to the castlevania faithful, but so be it. this isn't a review for them. this is for any but the most hardcore gamers who are castlevania fans, for those who might be as turned off as i was by this game's most serious deficiency: playability.
i define ""playability"" as the x factor [meaning it may be many things in many different games] that causes the player to never want to put the game down; it's the thing that keeps you up into the early hours of the morning playing ""just one more level."" and, most importantly, it's the thing that puts a smile on your face. playability leaves you anxious for more, and satisfied once you've finished that 100% completion; it's the thing that makes you just the tiniest bit unhappy when you're done because you don't know how long it will be before you have such a rich, rewarding gaming experience again.
it is this type of playability that ""rondo"" lacks. it's a beautiful game to look at, and it certainly delivers a solid 3d/2d side-scrolling castlevania experience. but that experience is hampered by the masochistic difficulty of the game. i'm all for challenging gameplay, and i wholeheartedly believe that a game should reward the gamer's developing skills by increasing in difficulty as levels get higher, but ""rondo of blood"" is punishingly, frustratingly difficult from the beginning--and extremely unforgiving of small mistakes: time and again you will find yourself taking damage due to the most miniscule misplacement of your character, and even small enemies deal out damage that drains large amounts from your health meter. again, i love a good challenge, but i also like to be rewarded for gaining the skills to overcome that challenge. i want that feeling of satisfaction that comes when you know you've finally figured out the key to passing a certain level or beating a certain enemy--that you've risen to the challenge. unfortunately, that feeling is rare with ""rondo."" rather, the feeling i most often had at the end of a level was relief that i'd finally broken through, and the suspicion that it was luck more than anything else that finally got me there. and i was usually ready to turn the game off, which in my opinion is the one emotion that a game should never, ever evoke in a player: you should always shut down your system with regret, not relief! and, more than anything, the gamer should never want to throw his controller (or entire system in this case) out of frustration. i'm looking for positive emotions from my gaming experiences, and that type of deep frustration is as negative as it gets--but it's one that i felt all too often playing ""rondo of blood.""
i am a very casual gamer (2 or 3 titles per year), and there are just too many good games out there for me to spend time on anything that delivers so much frustration and so little satisfaction.
i love castlevania, and ""symphony of the night"" is my favorite game of all time, but i just can't recommend ""the dracula x chronicles"" to anyone but the most hardcore castlevania fans.",1,game,first thing first review symphony night symphony night would 5 shiny gold star top however review dracula x chronicle large part remake rondo bloodthus 1 star include sotn bonus content beat rondo play symphony 2 star rondo blood know rating border blasphemy castlevania faithful review hardcore gamer castlevania fan might turn game serious deficiency playability define playability x factor meaning may many thing many different game cause player never want put game thing keep early hour morning play one level importantly thing put smile face playability leave anxious satisfy finished 100 % completion thing make tiny bit unhappy do know long rich reward game experience type playability rondo lack beautiful game look certainly deliver solid 3d2d sidescrolling castlevania experience experience hamper masochistic difficulty game challenge gameplay wholeheartedly believe game reward gamer develop skill increase difficulty level get high rondo blood punishingly frustratingly difficult beginningand extremely unforgiving small mistake time find taking damage due miniscule misplacement character even small enemy deal damage drain large amount health meter love good challenge also like reward gaining skill overcome challenge want feel satisfaction come know finally figure key pass certain level beat certain enemythat rise challenge unfortunately feel rare rondo rather feel often end level relief would finally break suspicion luck anything els finally get usually ready turn game opinion one emotion game never ever evoke player always shut system regret relief anything game never want throw controller entire system case frustration look positive emotion game experience type deep frustration negative getsbut one felt often play rondo blood casual gamer 2 3 title per year many good game spend time anything delivers much frustration little satisfaction love castlevania symphony night favorite game time recommend dracula x chronicle anyone hardcore castlevania fan

"far cry is really interesting to me.  it is one of the first entries in the ""open world fps"" genre and it not only sticks with that approach, it doubles down on it.  i can feel the influence of cinematic titles like ""dead island' in the presentation here, and that is not a bad thing.  the story is interesting in a b+ action thriller kind of way, and the island environments are beautifully rendered.  the mix of running and gunning and crafting and questing might not be for everyone, but i think anyone looking for a kind of modern world first person action rpg will be happy with what they see here.

with the details maxed out the game looks fantastic and has commensurate requirements.  it runs well at the very high end (my system is 3d surround, tri-sli titan), but not as well as crysis 3 (by comparison).  still though, dialing down the details on lower end setups should yield good framerates and, as is the case with many modern pc titles, the engine scales well and looks great even with reduced settings.

"prior to purchasing my copy of quicken essentials for mac, i had read the many negative reviews about qem and was wary about this product. i test drove most of the competitors first and was not much impressed with those either (ibank 4 being the possible exception if you can get past some of their amateurish gui design). eventually, i succumbed and decided to see for myself just what qem could do for me. to my surprise it has turned out to be the ideal solution. i think this is primarily due to the fact that i use quickbooks for mac for my business accounting. quickbooks handles the kind of ""heavy lifting"" that qem lacks which i think is what many users are looking for in qem and find disappointing. when paired with quickbooks, however, i've found qem to be an ideal compliment. in fact, there are some aspects that i actually prefer to quickbooks: the way qem handles online banking, for example, is much better than the awkward ""stacked"" registers in quickbooks. qem also manages to circumvent my bank's paid ""web connect"" quicken transaction download service with a free technique they apparently borrowed from mint! sweet!

"i bought halo 2 because i didn't have an xbox and it was cheap. i installed it and had a lot of fun, but only after turning the quality down to low, resolution to its minimum (800 x 600), and disabled all of the nice video features like anti-aliasing and high refresh rate to make it run at a reasonable speed. plus, i had to do a whole lot of tweaking...

my biggest complaint about this grip is that the edges are squared off, which dig into my hands. i think if the edges had been rounded off this grip would be perfect. since the edges dig into my hands, the grip really doesn't make it that much better than the 3ds without the grip.

"i typically do not do product reviews, but this time i am making an exception because there is nothing more critical to me than than my finance software and this version of quicken definitely has issues...

i upgraded from q2011 to q2014... if you go this route, make sure that you back up your 2011 files before they are converted as part of the 2014 installation... you may have to re-install the old version (it is uninstalled as part of the q2014 installation). intuit should run a standard compatibility check first before executing the installation process (or provide a way to revert back to the old software).

unfortunately, the 2014 release of quicken will simply not run on my w7 (i5) desktop, and it barely runs on an alternate computer, a samsung w7 (i3) laptop on which i've installed in until the problems are fixed.

my challenges:

> it crashes, on my w7 desktop. this is the only program that i have ever had any problem with. (i run both photoshop cs5 & lightroom 5 on this machine: it is definitely up to the task).

> on my samsung i3 laptop, q2014 will not run in a maximized window; i end up looking at a blank screen. i have to use it after manually stretching the quicken window, until it is just shy of full screen to make it useable. in this mode the fonts are so large that i cannot view all the ledger fields at 1366 x 788 (in the laptop) or 1440x900 (via an external monitor) resolution.

i simply did not have these problems with quicken 2011.

i patiently spent two separate sessions on the phone with intuit quicken tech support and they were simply not able to help. i ended up sending data dumps to assist with troubleshooting, and i still await resolution. their initial follow-up response was to upgrade to the latest 2014 update (v6, i believe)... it did not help a bit. i am still, patiently, waiting for a resolution.

i have a long history with quicken. i depend on it.  when the issues are resolved i will be happy. until then my advice is, when upgrading to 2014 from an earlier release proceed with caution, and be prepared to revert back to (re-install) the previous version.

hopefully issues will be resolved soon for those that use online updates, before support for q2011 online account updates ends in april...  this is the only reason why i decided to upgrade, otherwise q2011 worked perfectly fine for what i need to do.",2,software,typically product reviews time make exception nothing critical finance software version quicken definitely issue upgrade q2011 q2014 go route make sure back 2011 file convert part 2014 installation may reinstall old version uninstalled part q2014 installation intuit run standard compatibility check first execute installation process provide way revert back old software unfortunately 2014 release quicken simply run w7 i5 desktop barely run alternate computer samsung w7 i3 laptop instal problem fix challenge > crash w7 desktop program ever problem run photoshop cs5 & lightroom 5 machine definitely task > samsung i3 laptop q2014 run maximize window end look blank screen use manually stretch quicken window shy full screen make useable mode font large view ledger field 1366 x 788 laptop 1440x900 via external monitor resolution simply problem quicken 2011 patiently spend two separate session phone intuit quicken tech support simply able help end send data dump assist troubleshoot still await resolution initial followup response upgrade late 2014 update v6 believe help bit still patiently wait resolution long history quicken depend issue resolve happy advice upgrading 2014 early release proceed caution prepare revert back reinstall previous version hopefully issue resolve soon use online update support q2011 online account updates end april reason decide upgrade otherwise q2011 work perfectly fine need

"(i haven't tried the expansions so these are just a few thoughts on fable 2 main content only.)
while it is a great improvement over fable, i was disappointed when i finally played this game. fable 2 is larger and allows for more play time than the original, however...

*gold, easy to get, so what do we do with our millions?  once you buy all the shops/houses, then what?
*weapons.  nice array of weapons, i do like the use of guns and crossbows.
the ""best"" of them are quite expensive, but buy a few shops, don't play for a day or 2, and you'll have the gold in no time. (gold is earned even if you aren't playing)
augments on the weapons to make them stronger/better. i do enjoy the feature, but why can't we socket new augments over old ones?  you get a nice weapon, don't like the augments it came with? too bad.

the main reasons for my disappointment;
 *""open world""  well, kinda. if your thinking world of warcraft or fallout 3, no.
you can run a little ways then hit the ""no farther"" mountains, rocks, trees ect.
 *co-op, play with your friends and complete quests. not really. they show up as a henchman, and you really can't get too far away from each other. your locked to using the same screen. your friend can't be off killing some town and ask you to come over and help.  such potential, and yet they seemed to just over look all it could have been.
 *the controls seem ""clunky"", often frustrated with the character movement. i am  running into objects, getting stuck on nothing, a simple step for many games is an obstacle for this one.  you can jump over a fence, but try to go up steps from the side, and you can't.

this all seems negative but i did enjoy the game.
i'm just offering a little of my perspective for future buyers.
(maybe even developers)

if you have played this game before, earlier in your life, and you would like to play sim farm for sake of old memories or to add onto your sims collection... i strongly reccomend it.

"probably the most fun you will get out of a wrestling game. for those that liked the old wrestlemania arcade game that was on the consoles and actual arcade cabinets, this will deserve a look due to both games over the top gameplay.

pros:
-some of our favorite characters from the past are in here.
-nice animations for the signature moves and finishers..although, very exaggerated. but that is part of the appeal to some degree
-when you can nail your finishers, it is very satisfying
-easy to pick up and controls are easy learn for the most part.
-different modes/ways to play

cons:
-would have swapped out some of the choices of wrestlers they put in.
-would have liked more arenas.
-the intros are short and kinda meh.
-some of the wrestlers have moves that they were not even known for.
-the character models are beyond exaggerated and often very similar to one another. there should have been a better contrast in model sizes, even with the roided out buff look.
-the reversal system can be quite tricky to pull off sometimes. timing is very critical and if you rely on button mashing the trigger buttons to pull this off, you will get owned each time. the confusion alot of people have is that they are hitting the trigger button(s) when the icon shows on the screen, whereas, that simply means you inputed it too late. therefore, this requires studying the movements of your opponent in order to pull it off.

overall, its a decent rental. id rent before buying to see if you can handle the reversal system as that would be a sticking point in terms of replayability.",1,game,probably fun get wrestling game like old wrestlemania arcade game console actual arcade cabinet deserve look due game top gameplay pro favorite character past nice animation signature move finishersalthough exaggerated part appeal degree nail finisher satisfy easy pick control easy learn part different modesways play con would swap choice wrestler put would like arenas intro short kinda meh wrestler move even know character model beyond exaggerated often similar one another good contrast model size even roided buff look reversal system quite tricky pull sometimes time critical rely button mash trigger button pull get owned time confusion alot people hit trigger button icon show screen whereas simply mean input late therefore require study movement opponent order pull overall decent rental id rent buy see handle reversal system would stick point term replay

"i was extremely upset that turbotax could not deliver the results that were promised by intuit. when i tried to download financial information / data / reporting (employer, banks, investment firms, etc), i received an error message that data transfer was not possible and would need to be entered manually into turbotax. what? this would take me weeks to enter all of this data into turbotax manually due to the complexity of my taxes and sheer number of transactions from 10+ financial institutions. please note that i am definitely computer proficient...not a programmer but know my way around my laptop and software.

unfortunately, i was not able to resolve the issue even after working for weeks with technical support / customer service / online help to fix problem. it should be noted that i used professional tax preparer for my 2011 federal / state income tax returns and the overall process took about 3 hours. they had no problems downloading my financial information into their system with exact same vendors / transaction quantities.

finally, i started the tax preparation work for fy2012 and must admit that the q&a interview process was definitely insightful by highlighting tax situations that i had overlooked in previous tax years. unfortunately this process took much longer than i had anticipated due to the data download issue mentioned above...resulting in my manual entry of the financial / tax-related data.

at this point, i had completed my returns and ready to e-file my tax returns to both federal and state tax authorities. however, another software problem occurred when i tried to e-file my returns. per the error message from turbotax, i could not upload the documents electronically and had to print and mail the federal and state returns. once again, i was extremely disappointed with turbotax: their software didn't work, their customer service reps had no solutions, and had to resort to ""snail mail"" version. and then i had to stand in line at post office for over an hour to mail the returns. honestly, this whole process was unbelievable! do you think i will use turbotax for my fy2013 tax returns?  doubtful!!!",2,software,extremely upset turbotax could deliver result promise intuit try download financial information data reporting employer bank investment firm etc receive error message data transfer possible would need enter manually turbotax would take week enter data turbotax manually due complexity tax sheer number transaction 10+ financial institution please note definitely computer proficientnot programmer know way around laptop software unfortunately able resolve issue even work week technical support customer service online help fix problem note used professional tax preparer 2011 federal state income tax return overall process take 3 hour problem download financial information system exact vendor transaction quantity finally start tax preparation work fy2012 must admit q & interview process definitely insightful highlight tax situation overlook previous tax year unfortunately process take much longer anticipated due data download issue mention aboveresulting manual entry financial taxrelated data point complete return ready efile tax return federal state tax authority however another software problem occur tried efile return per error message turbotax could upload document electronically print mail federal state return extremely disappointed turbotax software work customer service rep solution resort snail mail version stand line post office hour mail return honestly whole process unbelievable think use turbotax fy2013 tax return doubtful

this year i bought the 2014 version and upgraded.  the upgrade went smoothly with no problems.  the update issue seems to be fixed too.  i did have problems trying to activate the quickbooks portion.  the verify your current info screen would not advance till i cleared all the info then retyped the same info back in.  i also had problems switching to the new enhanced payroll subscription.  it took 1.5 hours on the phone with customer support.  note that the number of employees included for paycheck generation went from 3 down to 1.  and to make matters worse, intuit requires a credit card for activation even though i only have 1 employee.  plus, you must ask to turn off auto-renewal.

wow, i was pretty disappointed in all the trouble i had activating the new version.  i was really mad about supplying a credit card even though my 1 employee was included.  it seems that intuit really wants the ability to auto-renew.  they charge the full retail price plus tax.  fyi, it's easy to buy elsewhere at 40-50% discount.

the support organization seems to really care.  they did go out of their way to help.  but, their effectiveness could be improved as the scripts didn't always reflect what the software actually did.  i spoke to a supervisor regarding the credit card issue.  she said that it was the accounting and engineering departments requirement.  she said many people were complaining about supplying a credit card number.  she said she was relaying the complaints to accounting and engineering.  i hope it makes a difference.",1,software,last year buy 2013 version work great except update feature always lock computer server busy error due many tcpip port use make sure shut web browser update year buy 2014 version upgrade upgrade go smoothly problem update issue seem fix problem try activate quickbooks portion verify current info screen would advance till clear info retyped info back also problem switch new enhance payroll subscription take 15 hour phone customer support note number employee include paycheck generation go 3 1 make matter bad intuit require credit card activation even though 1 employee plus must ask turn autorenewal wow pretty disappointed trouble activate new version really mad supply credit card even though 1 employee include seem intuit really want ability autorenew charge full retail price plus tax fyi easy buy elsewhere 4050 % discount support organization seem really care go way help effectiveness could improve script always reflect software actually speak supervisor regard credit card issue say account engineering department requirement say many people complain supply credit card number say relay complaint account engineering hope make difference
"being a parent whose kids love star wars, this game seems to be a good choice.  however, you have to sign up for a windows live account in order to save your progress in the game.  i spent 2 days trying to do this, only to find out that because i entered my son's name and birth date in the registration screen, i had to go to the windows live homepage and give parental permission for him to do the game.  that was a real pain in the a$# and i don't like the idea of the game connecting to windows servers during the game.  that's the reason i'm only giving this game 3 stars.  my kids however, both elementary students, think the game is 5 stars.  if you want a game for an older audience, i would recommend the force unleashed sith edition.  it's good for me and i remember watching the first star wars episode back in 1977 when i was in elementary school.  after playing that game, the force unleashed, the clone wars seems very simple and boring.",1,game,parent whose kid love star war game seem good choice however sign window live account order save progress game spend 2 day try find enter son name birth date registration screen go windows live homepage give parental permission game real pain $ # like idea game connect window server game reason give game 3 star kid however elementary student think game 5 star want game old audience would recommend force unleashed sith edition good remember watch first star war episode back 1977 elementary school play game force unleash clone war seem simple boring

"sturmovik is a solid wwii game from 505 games and worth a look if you like flight games.

story - the story behind this game is basically the retelling of personal experiences from a variety of pilots across the european theater of wwii. i wouldn't say the story is particularly compelling and the narrator has a bit of an accent which can make it difficult to understand. i assume most people don't look for a strong story in their wwii aerial shooters so no big deal.

visuals & sound - players should be quite content with the sights and sounds of this game. the world is bright and colorful with plenty of detail. i am pretty confident in saying that this game looks better than ace combat 6 and blazing angels. the sound is excellent with all of the exciting engine sounds and explosion effects. i noticed quite a bit of screen tearing in the cockpit view and am not sure if this is primarily a ps3 issue. there were some frame-rate issues during the more epic battles.

controls - the controls are pretty terrible and will take you quite a while to get used to. clicking the stick to look around is awkward. could have used customizable controls.

gameplay - this game is fun but can be slow and difficult at times. you are not flying a jet so it takes a while to get around the enormous maps. i would advise sticking to the arcade difficulty unless you really prefer more of a simulation level experience. the realistic and simulation difficulty levels are quite a challenge and you will spend a great deal of time trying to shoot down enemies.

multiplayer - didn't try it out.

overall this is a solid, well made game but it isn't for everyone. if you like flying games i would highly recommend this title. if you prefer more fast paced shooters like cod4 or halo then it probably isn't for you.

"this game came highly recommended to me and got good reviews, but i have to say that this is one of the most infuriating games i've ever played. yes, 2 of the 3 mini-games that are initially unlocked are fun, but to get the other 3 mini games you have to play the main game, and the main game is infuriatingly not fun. actually, the first 5 or 6 levels or so are pretty fun, but then it rapidly, and painfully, gets difficult. it's a lot like marble madness, except for the fun part. a key difference between the way marble madness worked and the way this works is that in marble madness, if you fell off an edge you lost time, but were placed roughly back where you were before you fell off. in super monkey ball, if you fall off you have to start the level entirely over again. combine that with levels involving balance beam precision and what you end up with just isn't fun.

i made it through the easy levels, but decided i'd had enough only a short way into the medium difficulty levels. an hour into it and i was only less than halfway to unlocking one mini game. it's just not worth it. my advice would be to only buy this game if you have an action replay to unlock all the mini games right away, or if you have friends/family who have a save with all the mini games unlocked that you can copy to your memory card. the mini games are fun, and smb should have been entirely mini games.",1,game,game come highly recommended get good review say one infuriating game ever play yes 2 3 minigames initially unlock fun get 3 mini game play main game main game infuriatingly fun actually first 5 6 level pretty fun rapidly painfully get difficult lot like marble madness except fun part key difference way marble madness work way work marble madness fell edge lose time place roughly back fell super monkey ball fall start level entirely combine level involve balance beam precision end fun make easy level decide would enough short way medium difficulty level hour less halfway unlock one mini game worth advice would buy game action replay unlock mini game right away friendsfamily save mini game unlocked copy memory card mini game fun smb entirely mini game

"i received this product as a christmas gift and was grateful for the ability to finally be able to edit and sync my ancestry.com tree to my desktop.

the pros on this software is that it is fairly easy to use an intuitive.  the ""leaf"" notifications for matches/suggestions from ancestry.com carry over seamlessly into the application.  although, there are times that i find their web interface easier to use.

the software downloads and makes copies of documents and images available on a user's computer itself.  this means that should a user's ancestry.com membership lapse or if it isn't renewed, the images of census documents, shared pictures and other such things are saved on a user's computer instead of not having access on the main site.

one of the biggest negatives i have found can be with syncing the tree between the software and the website.  a user can really mess things up if they select the wrong tree to update from.  for example, if a user selects to update from the web version of their tree with a conflict but, have been working on the software tree on their computer, all the changes will be erased.  it would be better if the software would check the time stamp on which tree was updated more recently and use that as the decision point.

another issue with the sync is that during periods of high traffic to ancestry.com, such as when they do a free access week to certain records or have a huge promotion, the sync is either delayed or does not work.  the week after christmas the software wouldn't sync hardly at all and constantly told users to ""try again in a few hours"".  the load balancing on the back end of ancestry.com's system needs to be updated to better accommodate these kinds of situations.

adding media such as pictures, stories and videos is fairly easy within the software and again, these documents will sync to the tree online.

the deluxe version of this software comes with a separate dvd/cd with ebooks of various genealogical resource books.  i have not looked at these so, i cannot vouch for how well they are put together or for the material in them.  it also comes with a 3-month ancestry.com american records trial to get a user started. (6 months if you get the sam's club version)

overall, i would recommend the software with the caveat that a user needs to make sure they are careful.  haphazard use of a software like this can wipe out years of research and effort.  otherwise, it is a great little piece of software, despite the sync issues and i would recommend it for anyone looking into their family history.  obviously it does work best with an active ancestry.com membership but, will still allow a user to catalog and organize their family tree without one.",1,software,receive product christmas gift grateful ability finally able edit sync ancestrycom tree desktop pro software fairly easy use intuitive leaf notification matchessuggestions ancestrycom carry seamlessly application although time find web interface easy use software downloads make copy document image available user computer mean user ancestrycom membership lapse renew image census document share picture thing save user computer instead access main site one big negative find sync tree software website user really mess thing select wrong tree update example user select update web version tree conflict work software tree computer change erase would better software would check time stamp tree update recently use decision point another issue sync period high traffic ancestrycom free access week certain record huge promotion sync either delayed work week christmas software would sync hardly constantly tell user try hour load balance back end ancestrycom system need updated well accommodate kind situation add medium picture story videos fairly easy within software document sync tree online deluxe version software come separate dvdcd ebooks various genealogical resource book look vouch well put together material also come 3month ancestrycom american record trial get user start 6 month get sam club version overall would recommend software caveat user need make sure careful haphazard use software like wipe year research effort otherwise great little piece software despite sync issue would recommend anyone look family history obviously work best active ancestrycom membership still allow user catalog organize family tree without one

review: i have been a die hard forza fan since it came out. i left gran turismo because of how much more enjoyable and realistic forza was. being a motorsports(keep that word in mind) fan, i loved circuit racing, tuning my car, and racing against other race car drivers. i used to spend countless hours just racing and tuning, racing and tuning. it was great. now, onto forza 5. i read the reviews of the die hard forza fans and thought ""well. it can't be that bad. none of the previous versions were bad. some were better then others, but overall, they were all good"" well i was wrong. i'll break it down into what i hated and what i loved:

hated:
1) the drivatar: if i wanted to be sideswiped by some 12 year old while trying to have a proper race, i would have played online. i play offline for a reason. i've seen these drivatars ride some really weird lines through turns, slam on their brakes in front of me for no reason, and go flying into a turn, just to sideswipe you, push you out of the way, and pass you. like i said, racing against a 12 year old. and the worst part of it all, you cant turn it off. i want to go back to the days of m. rossi. now they say it gets better if you turn the difficulty up to unbeatable. which it does. cars still run weird lines. occasionally will try and run you off the road, but it is tolerable, but that brings in another issue.
2) the races are short: when i say short. i mean short. 2-3 laps. i can't remember a race that was longer than 3 laps. i'm sorry. but a game with the word ""motorsports"" in it, should have decent races. this game has 10 races per series, all 2-3 laps long. i would rather have 2-3 races per series, all 10 laps long. the game also places you in almost dead last, usually something like 14th out of 16. i'm not opposed to competition, but 2 laps to pass 13 cars, when people are sideswiping you and cutting you off, is not easy. and you can't change this. leveling up does nothing, cars pi does nothing, cant qualify(you never could but it'd be a nice feature). now i would love to see an endurance race personally. i used to love the 2, 3+ hour races in gt. however i can understand them not being included. but 2-3 laps per race. what is this? need for speed?
3)stupid series challenges: or whatever they call them. i have never seen a racing series, where one of the races is a race track littered with garbage, cans, cones, all sorts of crap, and the object was to drive through it all as fast as you can. again. this is a ""motorsports"" game. not need for speed. such an event may be a fun event to play around in. but why does almost every racing series have such an event.
4) glitches. has this game even been beta tested? every single time i race the stupid speed through london on the tg test track, my sound freezes. i have to constantly pause and unpause the game to unfreeze the sound. car coming to a dead stop if i put a quarter inch of a tire on a sand dune you're not supposed to cut. static noise if the game is played for too long(need to restart the xbox fully to get rid of this)
5) the menu: the menu in this game is trash. although aesthetically pleasing, it is difficult to navigate and find options.
6) trophy system: 3rd place is gold now? what is this? elementary school where everyone needs a pat on the back for a job well done? no. 1st is gold, second is silver, third is bronze. frankly, i think this is last minute adjustment because they realized how borderline impossible it is to get from 14th to 1st in 2 laps while dodging what seems like 12 year olds that sideswipe you to get their way. that sentence actually sums up every race in this game very well.
7) cars: now i don't hate the cars. dlcs have been there for a while and the game does include a decent handful. but tuning them has become, odd. i can't quite put my finger on it, but somethings just not right. also, browsing for cars is horrible. also, gaining manufacture exp doesnt warrant free parts anymore.
8) money: you can make a descent amount of money, but the process is slow and unimaginative. no surprises. you don't get cars for winning series. you get small amounts for races, even the hard ones, a little more for completing the series, and then 35,000 for every level you go up. it's linear, it's boring,
9)the series are unimaginative. more or less there are some combination of: pick an a class car, restart race 15 times because you keep getting sideswiped by 12 year olds, or if you're on the highest setting, the 2 laps allotted isn't enough time to go from the back to at least 3rd. repeat this on some combination of road america, road atlanta, nurburgring grand prix, abu dhabi, stupid tg london challenge, silverstone, some kind of road fictional road course and 3 more random challenges. next series. same exact thing, but this time in a different car. and there aren't that many series in the game.
the good:
it looks gorgeous. it still puts a smile on my face to turn up the volume(when there's no static of course),  take a beautiful sounding car, and just go all out on nordschleife.
that's it.

maybe a patch will fix the performance issue.  even if it does, i dislike the graphics so much that i just don't want to play this game

update:  treyarch released a patch which was supposed to resolve the performance issues.  for me, it did very little to fix the problems with this game.  it did improve performance to the extent that i was at least able to finish this game, though there was stuttering throughout.  this made it very difficult to play, but at least i finished.  i was trying to convince myself that i hadn't actually allowed treyarch and activision to rip me off.  it didn't work.

if this game had been released ten years ago and cost $19.99 i'd probably be less angry.  i tried playing modern warfare 2, just to remind myself of how a great game should look and feel.  mw2 looks great, has excellent performance, an immersive story and is very much a game i enjoy playing over and over.  in other words, it's everything black ops is not.  as far as i'm concerned black ops is primitive in comparison.",2,game,1 expect graphic good good cod mw2 fact graphic look like something late ninety look muddy wash 2 expected game performance would equal good cod mw2 case single player get constant lag stutter current state game unplayable machine sure someone say problem machine know even low re game performance poor worth time trouble machine run mw2 without issue maybe patch fix performance issue even dislike graphic much want play game update treyarch release patch suppose resolve performance issue little fix problem game improve performance extent least able finish game though stutter throughout make difficult play least finished try convince actually allow treyarch activision rip work game release ten year ago cost $ 1999 would probably less angry tried playing modern warfare 2 remind great game look feel mw2 look great excellent performance immersive story much game enjoy play word everything black ops far concerned black ops primitive comparison

"i have had both the game boy player and the advance game port for a long time.

the biggest fundamental difference between the game port and the official gb player, is that the game port uses software emulation and the gb player uses true hardware emulation.

the game port uploads the both the gba rom and the game's save data into the gamecube's memory and uses a arm9 software emulator play the games.  the frame rate appears a little bit choppy, and the audio pitch is slightly off; making it seem almost like the effect of playing an ntsc game on a pal system - all gb games operate at 60hz, and although playback seems a little bit sluggish (maybe 50 hz?), this has the advantage of slowing down the game by about 16.7%, making overly fast-paced or challenging games slightly easier.

somebody mentioned that their's had a biult-in cheating device as well, but i recall nothing of that nature in my version.  a biult in feature to back up game savs (not roms!) to a gc memory card would also have been nice.

nintendo's official game boy player, on the other hand, uses official nintendo hardware to run gba games.  the gb player has built in to it, both an arm7 and an arm9 processor, making it able to play both gb classic, gb color, and gba games.

here are my pros and cons:

pros:

cheaper than a gb player, esp that both are out of circulation, and the gb player now is a collector's item!!!

this product will be the only full-screen gb option compatible with the nintendo wii (provided the wii is fully 100% compatible with gamecube, not 98% or 95%), since it only uses the cd tray and the controller/memory card ports.

the slightly slower frame rate may make fast-paced games somewhat less challenging.

cons:

choppy framerate at times.

audio pitch is a little flat.

due to the incompatible rom structure/ processor archetecture, it will not work with game boy classic or game boy color games.

overall, it is a nice accessory, but i have used it two or three times and my official gb player dozens and dozens of times.

"i have powerdvd 5, which is great. i only got powerdvd 10 ultra 3d because 5 doesn't work well on windows 7 and i wanted a powerdvd version that supports blu-ray playback. if you download the trial version you'll see all the interface problems this version has. why should a $100 program have interface problems? version 5 didn't and never cost this much. if you buy the full version of powerdvd 10 ultra 3d you can download the patch which fixes most of the interface problems, but not all. i agree that there's toooooo much commercialism packed into this program. it can be very annoying. the true theater video gives the picture quality more detail and it plays blu-ray but the 3d feature won't work on regular computer monitors. the true theater audio gives the sound more clarity and is a very nice addition to the program, but as far as i can tell, they haven't improved upon it enough to warrant the high price tag. i wouldn't have bought this if i hadn't been able to get it at a much lower price.

if you have windows xp or windows vista, don't have a blu-ray drive, and don't plan on upgrading to windows 7, get powerdvd 5. it's way better and way cheaper and no commercialism. powerdvd has definitely gone down the hill since version 5. i like powerdvd 10 ultra 3d but if you're gonna get a program this expensive, it has to be fantastic, not just ok.",1,software,powerdvd 5 great get powerdvd 10 ultra 3d 5 work well windows 7 want powerdvd version support bluray playback download trial version see interface problem version $ 100 program interface problem version 5 never cost much buy full version powerdvd 10 ultra 3d download patch fix interface problem agree toooooo much commercialism pack program annoy true theater video give picture quality detail play bluray 3d feature work regular computer monitor true theater audio give sound clarity nice addition program far tell improve upon enough warrant high price tag would buy able get much low price window xp window vista bluray drive plan upgrading windows 7 get powerdvd 5 way good way cheap commercialism powerdvd definitely go hill since version 5 like powerdvd 10 ultra 3d gon na get program expensive fantastic ok

given the electrical activity within a device like the the playstation 3, it's almost impossible to prevent a unit from getting warm, which is normal, but you can prevent it from getting hot. those who give the cooling station a bad review, especially the idiots on youtube, don't understand this difference.

the basic consept is you need to take care of a spa for cats and dogs.
the spa gets stars for how good it is, the games were fun at first but you
would keep doing them over and over. you have to do the mini games in order
to take care of the pets, and earn money.
pros
you sometimes get a special house call for a cat or dog and take care
of them for a few days.  then they go home.
you already own or always take care of a hamster, bunny, a bird, and a snake.
you can dress them and play with them or feed them. they have their own mini games
you can play but they get boring after a while.
some of the games can be a bit hard and for my younger sister its hard(shes 8)
cons
-you only have one profile and only one person for that profile.
-you have to stay in the aparment/spa
-you can't buy any animals but you have ""memories""

"disclaimer!! i got the sims as a gift from my wish list so i have no one to blame but myself!!

i have played most of the sim series with simcity2000 reduceing my college gpa by at least .5 so i was looking forward to playing the sims.  i have an older mac (7600 upgraded to a g3 266)but with upgrades i have been able to be reasonably current.  until now.  despite what the box says, the sims is not playable on anything less than a 400mhz g3 with at least 128mb of ram.  i have 80mb of ram (far more than the 64mb the box says is required) and with my ""gaming"" extension set i get 64mb of free ram at startup.  no dice.  i had to set virtual memory at 128mb just to get the sims to boot.  some other recomendations - dont try to play this on a 15"" monitor.  just not enought screen realestate.  given that every imac has a 15"", that is not good.  for older imac owners with 4mb or less of vram, good luck!  with an 8mb 2d card and a 4mb voodoo card i did ok but scrolling was still jerky (maybe with a faster processor and more real ram you could get by with less of a video card).

on the plus side the downloads available from the web site are top rate.  excellent support....

as for the game, i didn't pass my 15 minute test.  after 15 minutes i was thinking about booting up age of empires for a good thrashing of the greeks.  with a small screen it is too hard to see everything unless you zoom out and then you mis the details.  with time i know i will enjoy this game but there is a little too much ""real time"" - sitting waiting for something to happen.

i will hold final judgement for the sims until i can install it on a machine that is faster and has a bigger screen.  i don't mind finding a game that is too much for my machine to handle....

2 1/2 years later - i never did get to like the game but my daughter discoverd it sitting in a case and asked me to install it in my 17"" imac g4.  she loves it and so does my wife.  they both play constantly so i guess the problem is me not the game.

still a resource hog.  the game is very picky about the order that expansion packs are installed.  follow the directions sompletely and do a repair permissions before and after each expansion install.  aspyr barely provides supprt.  on the positive side, 100% of the downloaded objects that are listed as pc only have worked on my mac version.",1,game,disclaimer get sims gift wish list one blame play sim series simcity2000 reduce college gpa least 5 look forward play sims old mac 7600 upgrade g3 266but upgrade able reasonably current despite box say sims playable anything less 400mhz g3 least 128mb ram 80mb ram far 64mb box say require game extension set get 64mb free ram startup dice set virtual memory 128mb get sims boot recomendations dont try play 15 monitor enought screen realest give every imac 15 good old imac owner 4mb less vram good luck 8mb 2d card 4mb voodoo card ok scroll still jerky maybe faster processor real ram could get less video card plus side downloads available web site top rate excellent support game pas 15 minute test 15 minute think boot age empire good thrash greek small screen hard see everything unless zoom mi detail time know enjoy game little much real time sit wait something happen hold final judgement sims install machine faster big screen mind find game much machine handle 2 12 year later never get like game daughter discoverd sit case ask install 17 imac g4 love wife play constantly guess problem game still resource hog game picky order expansion pack instal follow direction sompletely repair permission expansion install aspyr barely provide supprt positive side 100 % downloaded object list pc work mac version

"i'm a computer tech in alaska.  i support about 150 users.  my job among other things is to try out new products for users, and i borrowed red hat from the other tech in my organization.  i tried loading it with no success to a 1ghz mini itx motherboard, and kept getting idle process failed error messages, and the install would just hang.
after about a day of that, i pulled up a 500 mhz gateway w/256mb ram and 40 gig drive.  the install went fairly easy and all modules loaded correctly except the sound module, which later properly installed, but reads as ""failed"" when shutting down.  i don't know what that's about.  ok, after the install i inspected the interface and found it to be quite easy to use.  you have to get used to all the different ways red hat refers to tasks etc. such as icons are called ""emblems.""
i opened the browser, mozilla 1.0, and it worked fine except when i went to download opera for linux, i was faced with a dozen cryptic flavors that i don' know about.  so i tried one for red hat and the install failed.  then i tried to connect to the local windows nt4 network, and it was so cryptic and hard to find networking that i gave up.  they recommend downloading a program called samba, to connect to windows, but if this function isn't built into red hat by default, they're going to lose potential customers.  it should be very easy to connect to a windows network, because, like it or not, that's the real world for now.  open office org seems okay, it's great to have a non microsoft alternative!

"- update jan 22, 2010 - and i thought the cheating was bad before, now i'm lucky to find any game where someone isn't using a hack.  that is, if you can get a game going.  this is a joke, i won't be buying the next version unless activision reverts back to the dedicated servers and apologizes for this $60 waste of my money.

- update dec 30th, 2009 - the cheating has become so bad now that the game is nearly unplayable. lowered rating to one star -

i consider myself an average adult player of pc games.  i can hold my own against others, but the guys that achieve the highest levels' possible in a matter of a week after release usually use me for cannon fodder.

cod: i've enjoyed the two previous installments of this game greatly.  i really like the multi-player games.  a small group of my friends would gather on a dedicated server on friday night and have fun just playing.  that has ended with cod mw2.

yes the graphics are better.

yes the weapons are cool.

but, i've gotten bored of the new maps already, and without mods and dedicated servers, i'm stuck playing the same maps again and again.  sure you can play a private game, but it does not count in any way for your character's experience.  you do not gain pts in private mode.  i would have been happy if there were two different experience ladders, one for private and one public.  i understand why the have just a public one, to cut down on cheating and stacking your character with your buds, more on that later.

expect things like : migrating to a new host server in the middle of your game!  the entire game will pause, then move you to a new server, then start back up.  it takes all the momentum out of the session.

expect being ready to play in the lobby, then suddenly the game kicks you out.  you try to get into a new lobby only at the mercy of the ""servers"" and end up playing the exact same map you just played.

expect to not be able to play at all for short periods of time while steam updates.  example, friday night, prime time usa - you can't play at 9 pm because steam says so.  ten minutes later is all seems fixed and you resume.

sorry - but this wasn't the game i enjoyed before.

expect to now pay for expansion maps, come on, i can't help but think that's what this is all really about - getting ca$h from the pc players instead of giving them the new maps.  you cannot make your own maps now, so you're again at the mercy of activision.  i'll be very surprised if the upcoming map packs are free.  i'll be even more surprised if there's a new cod next year for the pc at all.

cheating: steam is suppose to cut down on cheating, just like punkbuster supposedly did, but no - cheating runs rampant on steam.  firing a barret sniper rifle like a machine gun at the enemy with all head-shots?  sorry but when the lead player has 75 kills and the others all have 20, it stands out like a sore thumb.  i've watched the kill-cams, seen fair shots and wtf moments.

"as far as i can tell this product is completely useless. i purchased a headset designed for use with dragon, but it did not help. dragon ns runs painfully slowly and takes up 25-50 percent of the cpu on my reasonably fast laptop. the speech recognition lags way behind my speaking. it gets about one word in two correct for a sentence or two then hangs up thinking about what it is doing. speech recognition for sloths i guess. the dragon ns i used twenty years ago worked better and ran on a computer about 1/500th as powerful.

the software takes 90 seconds to start on my windows machine. when it is done it is already using 450mb of core memory.

there is a training option on a set of very long passages, but the font is so terrible and the un-resizable window is so small that it is very difficult to read. clearly these developers have no interest in the user interface. their solution to having a decent font and window is ""would you like to print it so you can read it from paper?""

"the only reason i bought jack was to be able to play with my human partner via the internet against jack. we thought the advantage of jack, as opposed to human opponents or gib opponents on bbo, was that our jack opponents could be programmed to play the conventions and treatments we wished to practice defending against and could also be dealt hands that would give rise to the use of those conventions (and that they would, of course, be infinitely patient during our post-mortems). of course we both bought copies of the program, since the documentation makes clear that jack must be running at both ends.

i am reasonably sophisticated about computers (though, i confess, not about networking on them), but we could not get jack to run over the internet. i emailed jack's creator in the netherlands about this and he did not deign to respond to my email. i hired a computer techie to come to my home and try to resolve this (with my partner on the other end during this session). this came to nothing, as well.

this was a very frustrating experience. the fact that i never got an answer from jack's creator makes me feel cheated.

"i used the h&r block software for last year's taxes.  three year ago i used the turbotax software.  they both work pretty much the same way.  yes, fast and fairly easy.  what really annoys me is that they both try to get you to buy other financial software or services they sell.  turbotax is worse in this respect.  once they get your e-mail address, expect a lot of spam.  the sad part is, for a person who has basic (uncomplicated) tax returns, they're really both a waste of money.  on the other hand, if you have lots of children, properties, businesses, and/or stock options galore, this review is not for you.

i'm a ""basic"" taxpayer.  i have a job, a small military retirement pension, i rent an apartment, and have no dependents.  i have always taken the ""standard deduction"", because i don't have enough deductions to itemize.  this software tries to find deductions, but in the end i always end up taking the standard deduction.  that's fine - but why am i paying close to $40 to e-file one federal return, and one state return?  i don't need ""5 federal e-files"".  that's one thing not mentioned when you buy this software - they charge extra for the federal and state e-file.  the total cost for software and e-files will be close to $60.  i suggest printing the returns off off and mailing them in to save money.  or better yet, if you made under $57,000, try out the irs's free tax filing system.

oh and h&r block - i knocked an extra star off because last year you missed the $5000 military pension deduction (for the state of maryland tax form).  you might want to fix that.

update to this review: the fee this year for e-filing 1 state return (the state e-file is not included in this package) is $19.95 per state according to the h&r block website.  the total cost will be $44.94 for 1 person to prepare and e-file 1 federal and 1 state return.  add $39.95 for additional states.",2,software,use h & r block software last year tax three year ago use turbotax software work pretty much way yes fast fairly easy really annoy try get buy financial software service sell turbotax bad respect get email address expect lot spam sad part person basic uncomplicated tax return really waste money hand lot child property business andor stock option galore review basic taxpayer job small military retirement pension rent apartment dependent always take standard deduction enough deduction itemize software try find deduction end always end take standard deduction fine pay close $ 40 efile one federal return one state return need 5 federal efiles one thing mention buy software charge extra federal state efile total cost software efiles close $ 60 suggest printing return mail save money well yet make $ 57000 try irs free tax filing system oh h & r block knock extra star last year miss $ 5000 military pension deduction state maryland tax form might want fix update review fee year efiling 1 state return state efile include package $ 1995 per state accord h & r block website total cost $ 4494 1 person prepare efile 1 federal 1 state return add $ 3995 additional state

"i had used sm5 basic, but never really got the feeling that it was maintaining my machine. when it's tools did run as scheduled it basically sucked up my system resources and rendered my computer useless until the tasks were completed.

bought sm6 pro not too long ago. initially it would hang while running certain maintenance jobs. subsequent updates fixed this problem. overall, i like the ease of use and it feels like the program is keeping my machine tuned up. however, it does so at the expense of performance. it takes programs noticeably longer to open and the tools are not customizable.

the undo function is completely inoperable and the only thing tech support could tell me about it (after contacting them twice and finally getting a reply almost three weeks later) was that they were looking into it and the problem might be fixed in future updates.

another major problem is that the security program shuts my home network down. i cannot access my main computer from any other computer in the house. the only way to fix this problem is to completely restore my hard drive from a saved image file (or else completely reload the computer from scratch).

sm6 could be a great program. many of the features and tools are valuable and run well, but the ones that don't wreak too much havoc. overall, it slows your machine down, does not allow you to customize the way tools run, destroys your network and cannot undo changes it makes to your system.

"i made the switch from quickbooks this year to money plus home and business, mostly because quickbooks was far more expensive to have automatic online updates from my bank and credit accounts.

i am generally very happy with money.  it's familiar platform makes it very simple for me to use.  it allows me to click on almost anything to see more detail.  the category system makes sense and is easy to edit.  online updates are relatively painless.

there are a couple features though that are laughably underdeveloped.  the invoice designer couldn't possibly be less user friendly.  it's barely worth trying to create a custom invoice design, but after hours and hours of figuring out the nuances, i was able to create something that looked okay at best.

another of my biggest complaints is that when i upgraded from the 60 day free trial to the actual product, i had to re-create my invoice designs.  i also had to re-set up some of my online account updates.  and when i was trying to do that, the merge accounts feature caused me all sorts of grief.

"i have a wii system that i thoroughly enjoy.  i don't have a lot of games, but the ones i do have get used a lot.  i ordered this megamix for one reason... it has the xevious game (one of the 24 games it comes with).

i didn't play a bunch of video games back in the day, but one i do remember that i enjoyed playing was xevious - it was a game in the rec-room of my dorm about 30 years ago.

the fact that there are 23 other games in the megamix is nice.

this game disk says the nunchuck attachment is required to play.  though all the games i played allowed for alternate control configurations to be used, some of which don't require touching the nunchuck at all.  for example, in pac man, you can use the ""plus"" sign on the wii controller to control the pacman through the maze *or* use the little joy stick control on the nunchuck.

i have to say that with the wii controller + nunchuck i struggle with controlling the activity during the games.  it's not the same thing as standing in front of the video game and leaning into the buttons :)  one thing that is annoying is that on the nunchuck the little joystick has 8 different directions it can be placed into (as opposed to just 4) so i have found that a little awkward when trying to control a car or a pacman or a jet plane in one of these old timey arcade games that only have 4 directions that they can go (i.e., forward, backward, left or right).

the graphics are comparable to the original.

as other commenters have pointed out, when you start the game disk, you are placed in an environment that you have to physically navigate, as a 3d pacman, to get from game to game.  there are 5 or 6 portals to different ""re-mixed"" games (e.g., a re-mix of pacman is a 3d pacman game, the re-mix of rally x is a little more realistic than the original game, and you get to choose your mii to ride in the car).  to get to the other 18 or so of the original arcade games you need to navigate to the ""arcade"" portal by rolling the 3d pacman to the door and then enter.

then you have to roll the 3d pacman to each individual arcade game to see which each one is, and then select it to play.

kinda klunky user interface.

a vintage arcade game store near my house sells reconditioned original arcade versions of these games for about $2000 a piece.  if i had 2 grand to blow i would definitely prefer getting the real thing.  in the mean time, this game cd for the wii for less than $20 will have to serve.

"i've used turbo tax since 2007, but the 2011 version won't install. apparently it has something to do with the microsoft .net 4.0 platform. does turbotax have a patch? nope. instead you have to go to their website where they tell you a story about microsoft .net. here's an excerpt: ""it is possible to have a corrupted or nonfunctional .net framework on your windows operating system without you noticing anything amiss. . . . think of [turbo tax] as an ""early warning system"" for missing or corrupted .net framework files that could potentially create additional problems in the future.""

in other words, they know this will cause headaches for a turbotax install even if nothing else is affected. after you spend $70 on the software, it will warn you. it won't install, fix the problem, and is utterly useless, but at least you'll have that warning. if you want to try and manually fix the problem, turbo tax suggests you contact a blogger. i'm not kidding. a sophisticated software company can't fix the program, patch it, or write it in a way that it will work because ""many programs currently built off the .net framework aren't as tightly connected to it as is turbotax"" so you should look around on the blogosphere and download some stuff and try to fix it your self. turbo tax says: ""click here to visit microsoft employee and .net expert aaron stebner's weblog and carefully follow his directions to download and run the .net framework cleanup tool."" but i didn't pay aaron stebner for the software, i paid turbo tax.

"when my turtle beach gaming headset unfortunately came to its demise, i started using this hausbell kotion g4000 and could not be happier with a gaming headset. in design, comfort, and overall function, this inexpensive headset is perfect for your gaming rig.

the design is eye-catching, so ill start with that. the deep reds and dark blacks compliment my alienware gaming computer perfectly. even if your laptop does not glow like mine does, this headset will show people around you that you have on a serious pair of headphones.

i have used this headset on voice communication applications such as ventrilo and teamspeak, as well as on dedicated in-game voice communications. the people who hear me say i am coming across clearly and audibly. the flexible microphone can easily be adjusted until it is at your preferred position; the microphone can also fold up fully if you are not engaged in communications and would just like to listen to music or listen to audio from videos. between using this headset for gameplay and music listening, i have spent over 30 hours within the first week, and have found the headset to be very comfortable.

whats slightly amusing is that my mother saw this headset and, without asking me, decided to put them on to test them out. she liked its comfort so much that she asked me to purchase her a pair so she can replace her plantronics multimedia headset  not for gaming, but for skype calls!

"i have used paperport for years (last version was pp 11) and have loved its functionality, but when recently migrating to a new windows 8.1 pc i hesitated to upgrade to paperport 14 given the generally bad reviews here. i searched high and low but could find no program that does what pp does in terms of file display and management. i did find some cheap simple scanner/pdf programs but i like the paperport view of windows explorer. i ultimately bought and downloaded pp 14 from amazon but the program was unable to see my scanner despite other programs having no such problem. with a little searching i found the scanner connection tool which i downloaded and ran and the problem was solved. everything is working fine and i am glad i took the chance with this software. the needed file can be found at the link below, otherwise just do a search for ""paperport scanner connection tool.""

"ok so this will be a long review because i have a lot to say and some important information that will save future buyers a lot of time.

ok so as far as how the item came, it was fine. it came on time and in one piece. so here is where it get's interesting.

when i first ordered this i read the reviews and saw that most people had the same issues, this being a 2015 software and we are still in 2014,  and it saying that the code was not valid.  so i expected to have that issue. and i did have it. so i called the 800 number after trying to un-install and re-install myself. the first person i spoke with was no help and did things that were not helping.

so when i called back a second time i got someone who knew their job. they helped me right away and it was very simple to follow their instructions. basically if you are having an issue installing it and it tells you that the license is not valid you need to go to settings and change how your computer is allowing access to the software.

now i can't recall exactly what you are suppose to do since that option to change the settings is only available when you are installing it initially, but if you need to call just mention to them that you think you may need to change the settings on how it's being installed and someone should be able to help you.

so be assured that it is not the code the code is fine and valid. but sometimes your computer is blocking certain access to things. so as far as my over all thoughts, the software does what it is suppose to do after you get it installed. i highly highly suggest and so do they, that after you install it, you do a complete scan of the computer. it won't take 9 hours like it says when it starts. it takes about 30 -45 minutes depending on what is going on with your system.

but it will fix any issues and it will protect your computer right away from that point on. so it does work,, but it's a pain to get up and going. i hope this helps you all and that you can find some clarity in this review. because i want you all to understand that it is a good software and will protect your computer, but you need to be pretty savvy when you talk to these people because as you know everybody is foreign and you can't get anybody to speak english and understand clearly what is going on.

that's just a fact. so be ready to stay on the phone a while to get your point across. but there are some people who do know their job and can help. good luck and remember to run a full scan after you download to get your computer cleaned up and running better as long as you have the software.",1,software,ok long review lot say important information save future buyer lot time ok far item come fine come time one piece get interesting first order read review saw people issue 2015 software still 2014 say code valid expect issue call 800 number try uninstall reinstall first person speak help thing help call back second time get someone know job help right away simple follow instruction basically issue instal tell license valid need go setting change computer allow access software recall exactly suppose since option change setting available instal initially need call mention think may need change setting instal someone able help assure code code fine valid sometimes computer block certain access thing far thought software suppose get instal highly highly suggest install complete scan computer take 9 hour like say start take 30 45 minute depend go system fix issue protect computer right away point work pain get go hope help find clarity review want understand good software protect computer need pretty savvy talk people know everybody foreign get anybody speak english understand clearly go fact ready stay phone get point across people know job help good luck remember run full scan download get computer clean run well long software

"graphics: anime-style look, character designs are decent.  areas can be a long stretch because the games is pretty large-scale.  but when you get to areas where enemies are populated, it's disappointing because many of the areas are simply left-to-right or right-to-left paths to get to the next time, sort of like a side-scroller, meaning there's not much exploration.  although when you equip new armor or weapons, it appears on the screen.

sound: music isn't bad, but not memorable either.  the voice acting is quite good though, and there's plenty of it.  the personality of the main character is shown through fun dialogue and voice-acting.  all the npcs have their own little sound bite and personality.

battle: you get to manually run up to the enemy and beat them senseless, unlike many other rpgs.  unfortunately, that can get repetitive as well.  and despite getting over 150 allies and choosing up to three to put into your party of four, you can only manually control the main character.

difficulty: this game is not particularly hard, but it can stretch if you want to collect every single character in the game (you'll have a chance to do that because there is a new game plus option when you beat the game)

other: 1) in this rpg, the place has it's own clock that goes 24 hours a day.  i figure it takes around 10 or 20 minutes for one hour to pass on the clock.  because of that clock, all npcs are controlled by their own routine by the hours.

2) you can get almost every npc in this game, if they look different from everyone else.  the game calls allies a more blunt name, friends.  unfortunately, you may not actually want to use many of them in battle because, simply put, a lot of them suck.  but some are needed to gain access to the much stronger allies along the way.

fun?:  this game is not for everyone, but i like games that allow me more freedom to just go up to the enemy and beat the crap outta them then just issuing time-consuming orders.  the dialogue and the voice-acting was funny, which is uncommon for many rpgs.  the main character is a dork with a mind for justice, but he has funny lines.  and lastly, npcs are pretty fun to talk to too!

"i've been a big elder scrolls fan ever since i played morrowind. this package was exactly what i've been waiting for. granted i own all of the games in another form for various systems (minus the first two, never played them before). but i'm a big game collector and this was a great addition to my collection, not to mention skyrim comes with all of the dlc and i needed them anyways so it was a good deal. i ended up buying it on sale so that made my decision a no-brainer but even at the full price its a great deal. if you consider that skyrim: legendary is $59.99 by itself, for the extra $20 you get all of the games, plus all of the expansion packs, so it's worth it.

the games come in a cool disc book. it comes with maps for each game. they are not as high of quality as the ones you get for the individual games, but they are still a nice feature (i ended up taking the maps from my other games and replacing them with those in the case).

the original two games are not steam compatible however, morrowind, oblivion, and skyrim can be downloaded and run by steam. skyrim actually has to be downloaded using steam in order to get the dlc. both oblivion and morrowind can be downloaded individually but in my opinion having them all on steam just keeps them organized better.

summary;
pros:
price is great if you are looking to get skyrim legendary edition or if you are just a fan and collector
comes with all the games and expansion packs/dlc
comes in a nice collectible case with all the maps
can be used with steam

cons:

- when the idisk size was increased it was long overdue

finally things have settled down but there are still a few rough edges. i've been using macs since 1988 and i love them but apple is not an innovator when it comes to web technologies. apple always seems to be playing catch-up.

there is no doubt that this is a useful package to enhance your os but i feel that apple charges too much given the flaws you have to put up with compared to free email and hosting services that while are less integrated, work better.

apple still has a lot to learn about webmail clients:

- putting up a loading message blaming its slow speed on your internet connection is an insult
- the editor is terrible
- searching is too slow
- very few configuration options
- it's always refreshing (arg!)

the syncing iphone services are essential and probably make this package worth the price. do not buy this just for the email support (unless you have an iphone).

"i had been waiting for this game to come out for a long time but this is not a video game at all. there is no gameplay at all; it does not matter what button you press or which direction you move in, the end result is the same. you can't die, you can't strategize, basically you cannot really control your character at all because you just follow the instructions on the screen! as a result, i did not feel excited or involved with the ""game"" at all. on the contrary, most of the time i felt frustrated and/or bored! for the majority of interaction on the screen, the ""game"" allows you to do mundane things like drink coffee, warm your hands at the fire place, sit on the bed but when it comes to action sequences most of it are cut scenes (to be fair even the drinking coffee is also a cut scene!!!). this is just ridiculous.

the story is very clich and the acting is, in my opinion very poor. i should also mention that 95% of the so called ""game"" is just actors acting out scenes. even if i was to assume this is not really a game and more of a movie, the story sucks! it looks and feels like a cheap movie made for tv. the dialogue is so bad that it makes me cringe. i really don't think that ellen page is suitable for the character she portrays and as for william dafoe, i think that his acting was just bad. if the developers spent a lot of time on this project, then i think they've spent time and effort in all the wrong areas.

graphics were not bad but what is the point if the game sucks?! there are much better games out there that live up to the hype; e.g. ""the last of us"" and ""grand theft auto 5"". please don't waste your money on this game. like some others have mentioned, try it out at the shop or rent it first.",2,game,wait game come long time video game gameplay matter button press direction move end result die strategize basically really control character follow instruction screen result feel excite involved game contrary time felt frustrated andor bore majority interaction screen game allow mundane thing like drink coffee warm hand fire place sit bed come action sequence cut scene fair even drink coffee also cut scene ridiculous story clich act opinion poor also mention 95 % call game actor act scene even assume really game movie story suck look feel like cheap movie make tv dialogue bad make cringe really think ellen page suitable character portrays william dafoe think act bad developer spend lot time project think spent time effort wrong area graphic bad point game suck much good game live hype eg last u grand theft auto 5 please waste money game like other mention try shop rent first

"i have three complaints, but otherwise found this easy to use.

first, what they don't tell you (at least not clearly) -- if you want to file electronically, you'll be forking over another $0.00 ($0.00 each for your federal and state return), with no rebate offers to cover the cost. that made this look cheaper than it really was. so plan to wait for the postal service to handle your return, or expect to pay more than the list price.

second, the interface is clunky when you're going through steps with a lot of options. for example, there are 22 different sources of income it asks you about. after you answer the questions for each one (and even if you skip it), you're returned to a screen that shows you've completed ""x of 22,"" with a summary of what you've done so far, and a continue button. the problem is, that summary of your steps that's pretty short after one or two items gets to be very long by the time you're on item 20, and the continue button is always at the bottom of the list. even if you've skipped an item, it shows up in the summary. as a result, you end up having to scroll down, sometimes several pages, to get to the ""continue"" button so you can keep working. and you have to start doing that every time, after about the third or fourth item...of 22 items. that's a lot of page scrolling, just to show you something it just showed you a few seconds earlier.

third, this software was able to import some data from last year's tax file, which i prepared using taxcut. unfortunately, it didn't import everything correctly -- it got much of the basic information, but i had to edit the entries for my dependents and it didn't import any of my schedule a data (it even thought i'd taken the standard deduction last year, which i clearly didn't). that was annoying, since some calculations required me to look up last year's return and type in values, and comparisons between this year and last year were incomplete or wrong.

edit: okay, fourth complaint. the included ""itsdeductible"" software only works for donations made in 2006. why is that a problem? i'd rather use it now to track the items i'm giving to charities today, so i have a total for my 2006 tax return -- but that's not possible. they expect you to save all your receipts for a year and enter them all in when you buy the software next year. why not let me do a little data entry while i have the paperwork in front of me, so at the end of the year i just have a folder of receipts and documentation, and a grand total already generated by the software?

even with those caveats, this is surely much easier than doing your taxes by hand. it's less expensive than working with a tax preparer. and it's more secure than storing your personal financial data on someone else's web server -- just make sure to encrypt your files, and move them off your computer (put them on a cd stored somewhere safe from theft or fire, in case you're audited).

i've used both taxcut and turbotax in different years, and each do a good job. i've also found things in each that were annoying, but never found anything that looked like it would generate an invalid tax return. i'm likely to switch back to taxcut next year, since i found the whole hidden fees and clumsy interface to be annoying, but this version certainly does what it promised.",1,software,three complaint otherwise find easy use first tell least clearly want file electronically fork another $ 000 $ 000 federal state return rebate offer cover cost make look cheap really plan wait postal service handle return expect pay list price second interface clunky go step lot option example 22 different source income ask answer question one even skip return screen show complete x 22 summary do far continue button problem summary step pretty short one two item get long time item 20 continue button always bottom list even skip item show summary result end scroll sometimes several page get continue button keep work start every time third fourth itemof 22 item lot page scroll show something show second earlier third software able import data last year tax file prepare use taxcut unfortunately import everything correctly get much basic information edit entry dependent import schedule data even think would take standard deduction last year clearly annoy since calculation require look last year return type value comparison year last year incomplete wrong edit okay fourth complaint include itsdeductible software work donation make 2006 problem would rather use track item give charity today total 2006 tax return possible expect save receipt year enter buy software next year let little data entry paperwork front end year folder receipt documentation grand total already generate software even caveats surely much easy tax hand less expensive work tax preparer secure store personal financial data someone els web server make sure encrypt file move computer put cd store somewhere safe theft fire case audit use taxcut turbotax different year good job also find thing annoy never find anything look like would generate invalid tax return likely switch back taxcut next year since find whole hidden fee clumsy interface annoy version certainly promise

"i have to say that i am glad this was one of the first games i played for xbox one. firstly, because it does a great job of showcasing xbox ones improved graphics over the last generation. some people may knock the new consoles for not being that much improved in the graphics department, but if you just take a second to look at details, such as lighting (ohhh the pretty lighting), number of enemies on screen, etc. you would see the vast improvement.

but what about being more than a graphical showcase? the game is a rail action/fighter game. for those who don't know what that means, simply put, you're constrained to a pretty specific path along the way with little opportunity of exploring, all the while you face waive of enemies that you get to mindlessly hack and slash. do i like this? not particularly. but it is what it is, so i tried to enjoy the game for what it was and not what it wasnt.

while theres not an open ended world to explore like many popular rpgs, you do however get small rpg elements when it comes to upgrading your player. use your xp to upgrade your fighter along the way. this is fun to a certain extent, but the campaign can be easily beaten in 6 hours or less. just when i was getting my fighters feet wet with upgraded skills and moves, bam! the game is over.

like i mentioned earlier, im glad i played this game first (because of the graphics), but also because it was so short i was able to quickly sell it on ebay and get most of my money back to invest in a different game! it would be easy to experience what this game has to offer (even if it is limited), and then move on to another launch title. enjoy it, experience it, and move on from it.

"i received the basic edition bundled with a very nice plextor burner. most of my experience so far has been with the emc 7 capture function.

the bundle itself is truly bloatware, and loads tons of stuff that you will never use. it would be nice if places like roxio would add a one-line description of each useless package's function, with the option to install or not after reading.

capture is the kind of program designed to be ""easy"", meaning you never really know what is happening. it does (mostly) capture video. however, it will hang periodically with cryptic messages, to which the only option is click ""ok"". then it starts over from the beginning.

the smartscan feature would theoretically be great (you must make sure your dv camera supports this function). my cam (pv-gs200) does. however, the purpose of smartscan is to fast-forward looking for scene codes on the tape, to let you preselect the scenes you want to capture. unfortunately, it gets lost, a lot. once capture has lost its place, the only option is to start back over at the beginning of the tape. it will invariably hang at the same places, so after wasting a lot of time and over-exercising the fragile tape, you will give up and just capture the whole damned tape (have a very big hard drive handy).

now that you're capturing the full tape, it will hang in other places. it hates when you have fast-forwarded the tape in camera, because that causes a black frame that it cannot seem to move past. eventually, you will find that the best option is to manually move past the spot with the controls on your camera, then start capturing from there... but you will never really know what the software is doing until its over.

never knowing what the program is doing, and having neither options nor meaningful help when difficulties are encountered, is the recurring theme of this whole software suite. the only help you will get from roxio is their user forum (which is pretty good); otherwise, their idea of support is to try to get you to buy an upgrade version.

i believe much of this stems from trying to make something which is still inherently complex (video capture) overly simple for some perceived grandparental audience. the problem with all the friendly screens is that they blithely assume nothing will fail. when problems inevitably arise, there is no recovery other than start over. you will never know where you are in a tape, where your restart begins, what happened to the video you may or may not have already captured, or what to do to manually jumpstart a stalled capture.

the same look and similar issues were thoughtfully embedded in the videowave authoring suite, although i have not had much experience with it, given that i am spending most of my time capturing and recapturing (i think).

i am not sophisticated enough to recommend something else yet, but there has to be something better and i would recommend you find it instead of anything from roxio. their whole progression as a software megabundler has been toward sales and away from functionality (and support) and it is really a shame that a first-class outfit like plextor had to ""partner"" with them.",2,software,receive basic edition bundle nice plextor burner experience far emc 7 capture function bundle truly bloatware load ton stuff never use would nice place like roxio would add oneline description useless package function option install reading capture kind program design easy meaning never really know happen mostly capture video however hang periodically cryptic message option click ok start begin smartscan feature would theoretically great must make sure dv camera support function cam pvgs200 however purpose smartscan fastforward look scene code tape let preselect scene want capture unfortunately get lose lot capture lose place option start back begin tape invariably hang place waste lot time overexercising fragile tape give capture whole damn tape big hard drive handy capture full tape hang place hat fastforwarded tape camera cause black frame seem move past eventually find best option manually move past spot control camera start capture never really know software never know program neither option meaningful help difficulty encounter recur theme whole software suite help get roxio user forum pretty good otherwise idea support try get buy upgrade version believe much stem try make something still inherently complex video capture overly simple perceived grandparent audience problem friendly screen blithely assume nothing fail problem inevitably arise recovery start never know tape restart begin happen video may may already capture manually jumpstart stall capture look similar issue thoughtfully embed videowave author suite although much experience give spending time capture recapture think sophisticate enough recommend something els yet something well would recommend find instead anything roxio whole progression software megabundler toward sale away functionality support really shame firstclass outfit like plextor partner

i seriously doubt a beginner will enjoy this software.  the beginner disks don't have any introductory phrases, doesn't discuss the alphabet, or numbers until you have already been forced to learn that hundreds of people get off the train everyday, creating a large crowd.  how about teaching, ""guten morgen,"" ""guten tag,"" and ""guten abend,"" or ""mein name ist..."" before learning ""erscheinung des totes"" is a ""gespenst""?

as for the person who said ""...the software recognizes your voice and can correct your pronunciation mistakes.""  not true.  i can say ""morgen"" with a thick southern accent and poor inflection and still receive 7/7 bars!

if you want the roms for your computer, save yourself some money and buy the 5 disc set for $20.  if you are a true beginner, listen to the additional 3 audio cds in the set to get some basic ""listening/speaking"" skills, before using the roms.

"i have played fifa games since 1995 with a new one every other year or so. i also have played pes 2012 and 2013 which i enjoyed for something different. i decided to try pes 2015 and i have to say i was very disappointed.

the biggest flaw in this game is that the ai defense is just too good, even on the easy levels. put a great through ball pass that cuts through the defense? the stoke cb will outrun messi and cut it out. try to run down the wing with robben (who has 100 speed)? the burnley defender will stop you. try to put in a cross to crouch? the cb will head it away. try to take a shot from outside the box? they will block it, or if you are lucky the goalie will save it.

basically this game is setup so it wants you to be like barcelona and playing the passing game, and move the ball around to pass the other team into submission, no fun allowed. the problem is that the passing mechanic isn't good enough to accomplish this. you get closed down very fast and finding an open man and getting the ball to him quickly is difficult. i find the passing movement on fifa to be a lot easier to move the ball around and actually keep the ball. in the settings, moving the pass assist bar up or down didn't seem to make any difference to the frequency of misplaced passes. fifa will allow you to select semi-assisted, or fully-assisted if you are having trouble with keeping the ball, if pes insists on passing being the most important part of the game, then they needed to get this right but instead it just feels clunky.

next, the defending is equally bad. i have heard the term warp defending used frequently. essentially, the defender will warp through the player with the ball. the ball is basically glued to the player and you go right past, or if you are lucky you will just foul him, repeatedly. actually winning the ball is very difficult. you pretty much have to resort to slide tackling to get the ball, and that is just too risky to use consistently.

in addition to the obvious annoyance with the lack of player/team licenses, the final nail in the coffin is the unbearably slow load times. the supposed good graphics is likely the issue here, but not only waiting for the game to start, but during the game the many fouls, yellow cards and if you are lucky enough to score a goal, replays, prompt multiple cut scenes and additional replays, that lag, and either cant be skipped or are frustrating to keep skipping. it really interrupts the flow of the game, much like the frequent substitution cut scenes on some fifa installments.

the only real excuse i can give is that pes 2015 put all of their development into the xbox one version, and the xbox 360 version was just slapped together, so you just get a clunky, lag-filled frustrating experience.

overall, i spent more time setting up the team names, giving arsenal a proper badge and kit, and making some transfers than i actually did playing this game. i wish i had played some matches before i bothered doing all that setup, and i will certainly be going back to fifa 15.

if you have an original xbox 360 and have encountered the issue where the disk tray gets stuck closed if you don't leave a disk in there, leaving your pes 2015 disk in there is about the only real use for it. dont waste your time actually playing the game.",2,game,play fifa game since 1995 new one every year also play pe 2012 2013 enjoy something different decide try pe 2015 say disappoint big flaw game ai defense good even easy level put great ball pas cut defense stoke cb outrun messi cut try run wing robben 100 speed burnley defender stop try put cross crouch cb head away try take shot outside box block lucky goalie save basically game setup want like barcelona play passing game move ball around pas team submission fun allow problem passing mechanic good enough accomplish get close fast find open man get ball quickly difficult find passing movement fifa lot easy move ball around actually keep ball setting move pas assist bar seem make difference frequency misplace pass fifa allow select semiassisted fullyassisted trouble keep ball pe insist pass important part game need get right instead feel clunky next defending equally bad heard term warp defend use frequently essentially defender warp player ball ball basically glue player go right past lucky foul repeatedly actually win ball difficult pretty much resort slide tackle get ball risky use consistently addition obvious annoyance lack playerteam license final nail coffin unbearably slow load time suppose good graphic likely issue wait game start game many fouls yellow card lucky enough score goal replay prompt multiple cut scene additional replay lag either cant skip frustrate keep skip really interrupt flow game much like frequent substitution cut scene fifa installment real excuse give pe 2015 put development xbox one version xbox 360 version slap together get clunky lagfilled frustrating experience overall spent time set team name give arsenal proper badge kit make transfer actually play game wish play match bother setup certainly go back fifa 15 original xbox 360 encountered issue disk tray get stick closed leave disk leave pe 2015 disk real use dont waste time actually play game

also, because the nuvi goes into pedestrian mode, when i parked our car, i was able to save it in favorites and easily find my way back when the time came.  but as for having the europe card, it was so much more productive to know exactly where to walk to see different sites.

also, the sights and restaurant suggestions were pretty good and up to date.

one criticism is that sometimes when i put in a smaller town to drive to, there were several towns with the same name and while i could logically figure out which one i wanted by the distance, some of the regions and countries were mentioned in foreign languages which made it confusing.  in other words, all of a sudden, when they would name the country the town was in, they would use the austrian word for ""austria"" for no apparent reason at all.  a minor disturbance for

"i bought this software with high hopes but ultimately ended up returning it after running into limitations that made finishing my design project impossible. my situation: i am landscaping my backyard with 4 raised planter beds, a flagstone path, small paving stone ground-level patio, and a small fish pond in a raised planting bed surrounded by stone. existing backyard features include a fence, tree, raised concrete porch attached to the back of my house.

creating a serviceable exterior facade of my house was reasonably straightforward, after i got the foundation offset right. the caveat - when editing default dimensions in your plans, be sure to delete the (d) symbol. merely changing the number will not affect the dimensioning, and it will revert to the default value. this is not documented in the included booklet, but i found it on the support website.

the 3d views work well, although (perplexingly) this product is not hardware accelerated and supports real-time 3d only in a low quality mode. still, the software developer in me chalks this up to ease of implementation and widest hardware compatability, so this is excuseable.

basic modification of the backyard was fine (placing the tree and fence), but at this point i ran into problems:

the raised planter beds - retaining walls are supported in the context of the contoured landscape mode, however my yard is flat, and the software does not consider low raised walls around planting beds as ""retaining"" walls. the hack is to use the generalized ""landscape feature"", which is drawing tool that allows you to create simple extruded shapes. however, these are not ""walls"" from the software's perspective.

the raised fish pond - same issue as the planter beds.

flagstone path - the 2d overhead view of the path worked well, but to my surprise there are no tools for estimating the amount of materials needed. have 16"" flagstones and a curving path? want to know how many stones you need? me too. this ties into a general gripe i have with the software - lack of standard cad features. the ability to measure areas, volumes, and so on is one of the main reasons cad is even useful, and these features (by their phone support tech's admission) are completely absent in any meaningful sense. other standard cad features such as hierarchical groups of objects are also missing, as are copy/pasting of anything other than individual objects.

paver patio - curiously, outdoor hard surfaces are implemented as ""floors"" with hidden walls, as documented in the (well produced) help videos. for a landscape program this feels like a strange hack, and falls prey to the cad limitations above when attempting a materials estimate.

to summarize: i quickly hit a point where the lack of what i consider standard cad features made the software irrelevant to my project. if you just want to get an idea of the general look of several design alternatives it may work quite well for you, but for serious materials estimates it falls short. chief architect's 30-day satisfaction guarantee is quite generous and their support reps are friendly, so i don't feel like the experience was a waste. however, i will probably not purchase landscaping software in the future without first verifying its ability to do ""proper"" area and volume calculations.",1,software,buy software high hop ultimately end return run limitation make finish design project impossible situation landscape backyard 4 raise planter bed flagstone path small pave stone groundlevel patio small fish pond raise plant bed surround stone exist backyard feature include fence tree raise concrete porch attach back house create serviceable exterior facade house reasonably straightforward get foundation offset right caveat edit default dimension plan sure delete symbol merely change number affect dimension revert default value document included booklet find support website 3d view work well although perplexingly product hardware accelerate support realtime 3d low quality mode still software developer chalk ease implementation wide hardware compatability excuseable basic modification backyard fine placing tree fence point run problem raise planter bed retain wall support context contour landscape mode however yard flat software consider low raise wall around plant bed retain wall hack use generalize landscape feature draw tool allows create simple extruded shape however wall software perspective raise fish pond issue planter bed flagstone path 2d overhead view path work well surprise tool estimate amount material need 16 flagstone curve path want know many stone need tie general gripe software lack standard cad feature ability measure area volumes one main reason cad even useful feature phone support tech admission completely absent meaningful sense standard cad feature hierarchical group object also miss copypasting anything individual object paver patio curiously outdoor hard surface implement floor hide wall document well produce help videos landscape program feel like strange hack fall prey cad limitation attempt material estimate summarize quickly hit point lack consider standard cad feature make software irrelevant project want get idea general look several design alternative may work quite well serious material estimate fall short chief architect 30day satisfaction guarantee quite generous support rep friendly feel like experience waste however probably purchase landscape software future without first verify ability proper area volume calculation

"i have been using peachtree complete, now known as sage 50 complete, for years and the peachtree accounting programs in general since back in the days of dos. my needs are for simple bookkeeping and payroll, and although you can get a peachtree/sage program for simple bookkeeping, you must step up to the expensive sage 50 complete if you intend to do payroll.  not only that but you must also pay a small fortune to keep the payroll tax tables up to date.

for my needs sage 50 complete is overloaded with reports that are absolutely worthless to me and my bookkeeping/accounting needs.  i would like to see a smaller less expensive sage program for payroll and simple bookkeeping combined, and less expensive tax table updates.  i can follow the formulas to update the tax tables myself, but do enjoy the automatic updates, just in case i miss something.  and, i would like to have the ability to list sub-categories for the accounts, which is not available in the peachtree/sage line.

large companies with large accounting needs that can utilize all the reports might like this program.  for small businesses like mine it is an expensive bloated program, but unfortunately a necessary one because of my payroll. it angers me that they require you to upgrade programs every three years.  i almost switched to quickbooks, but not knowing too much about that program and the costs being nearly the same, i elected to stay with peachtree.  however, the next time they force me to upgrade due to payroll i will probably jump ship.  i don't hate it, but i don't love it either.

update 12/12/13:  the review above was written aug 19, 2012.  things have changed since then and not for the better.  as mentioned above peachtree requires you to enroll in a payroll service plan in order to get updated payroll calculations and forms (printed from the program). in the past it was roughly $300 per year, which was bad enough. however, this year they bumped that price to $800 per year, and there is no way around it. i refuse to pay that, and thus, from here on out, i will calculate our payroll deductions myself, complete payroll reports by hand, and complete our w2 forms - for free - on the social security admins website. and i will not upgrade peachtree in future years. i will run my current peachtree program to the ground, and then find something else.  here is an article on the subject. [...]

i gave it 3-stars,for ""ok"".  2-stars would be for ""i don't like it"".  although, i don't like what they did with the payroll, the rest of the program is ""ok"", rating it three stars.",1,software,use peachtree complete know sage 50 complete year peachtree account program general since back day do needs simple bookkeeping payroll although get peachtreesage program simple bookkeeping must step expensive sage 50 complete intend payroll must also pay small fortune keep payroll tax table date need sage 50 complete overload report absolutely worthless bookkeepingaccounting need would like see small less expensive sage program payroll simple bookkeeping combine less expensive tax table update follow formulas update tax table enjoy automatic update case miss something would like ability list subcategories account available peachtreesage line large company large account need utilize report might like program small business like mine expensive bloat program unfortunately necessary one payroll anger require upgrade program every three year almost switch quickbooks know much program cost nearly elect stay peachtree however next time force upgrade due payroll probably jump ship hate love either update 121213 review write aug 19 2012 thing change since well mention peachtree require enroll payroll service plan order get update payroll calculation form print program past roughly $ 300 per year bad enough however year bump price $ 800 per year way around refuse pay thus calculate payroll deduction complete payroll report hand complete w2 form free social security admins website upgrade peachtree future year run current peachtree program ground find something els article subject give 3starsfor ok 2stars would like although like payroll rest program ok rating three star
"this is a good software (at least i find so). however, microsoft has discontinued support for all money products. if ur still interested in this product - go to microsoft website and search ""money sunset"" in their download center. you will find two links ""money plus sunset home and business"" & ""money plus sunset deluxe"". download either and install - you do not need any previous versions, no activation required and its free (shhh!!!!). so far as i can tell, both seem to have full functionality. only difference is that you will have to manually input your banking transactions - online updates from your banks are no longer available.

it can convert and open older versions of money - but with 2005 deluxe files, the backup errors out when closing the file. you will have to activate the backup from the menu bar. might be better to balance out your older files, get the balances, then set up a fresh file in sunset. sunset works in xp, vista & windows 7.

if you are not already a money user, i don't think you should start - it is really tedious to set up your accounts and get balances etc. and it would be tiresome if 5-6 years in the future if windows stops supporting sunset entirely and you have to upgrade your computer - then you might have no choice but to setup your accounts all over again in whatever new software package is available on the market.",0,software,good software least find however microsoft discontinue support money product ur still interested product go microsoft website search money sunset download center find two link money plus sunset home business & money plus sunset deluxe download either install need previous version activation require free shhh far tell seem full functionality difference manually input bank transaction online updates bank longer available convert open old version money 2005 deluxe file backup error close file activate backup menu bar might better balance old file get balance set fresh file sunset sunset work xp vista & windows 7 already money user think start really tedious set account get balance etc would tiresome 56 year future windows stop support sunset entirely upgrade computer might choice setup account whatever new software package available market

"for macs running 10.9.4 - please read:
we've used norton anti virus for mac on several machines in our house for years with no problems. this month i purchased it twice and loaded it on two different macbook pro's, both running osx 10.9.4.  i purchased them from amazon for the best price but i did not download from amazon. i followed the instructions left by another reviewer which i have copied here. it worked like a charm both times.

in addition to these instructions i would add, first i used the symantec uninstaller found in the applications folder. then follow the reviewer's instructions below. then copy the product key found in your amazon confirmation email. open norton antivirus (your free trial version) and there will be a button to click to ""purchase now"". then choose the option to use the product key you copied and paste it in. it will confirm that your subscription is now good for 366 days.

the following is copied from a prior reviewer:
amazon's installer works... only if you're not on os x 10.9

platform for display: mac downloadverified purchase
because of the number of problems folks seem to be running into installing this on mavericks (10.9), i decided to make a note of this in a review to help out those struggling to install this.

first, to figure out what version of os x you are running, click the apple icon on the top left of your screen, then click on ""about this mac"". a window will pop up, and you should clearly see ""version 10.x.y"". you should generally be able to ignore the y value; instead, pay closer attention to the 10.x portion.

*(as amazon disallows links to non-amazon pages, i'll try to be as descriptive as possible). if your version is 10.9, google for ""norton antivirus downloads"" (without the quotes). click on the result that directs you to norton's site, and search through their pages to find the trial version of norton antivirus. the link you want should be within a section of their site under ""other norton free trials"". you then want to click the link that says norton antivirus 30-day free trial for macs. following that, click the big yellow button to actually begin the download.

once you install that, just plug in your license key and you should have the software activated. note that you can do this anytime during the trial instead, if you'd like an extra 30 days for free ;).",0,software,mac run 1094 please read use norton anti virus mac several machine house year problem month purchase twice load two different macbook pro run osx 1094 purchase amazon best price download amazon follow instruction leave another reviewer copy work like charm time addition instruction would add first use symantec uninstaller find application folder follow reviewer instruction copy product key find amazon confirmation email open norton antivirus free trial version button click purchase choose option use product key copy paste confirm subscription good 366 day follow copied prior reviewer amazon instal work os x 109 w rezieon may 7 2014 platform display mac downloadverified purchase number problem folks seem run instal maverick 109 decide make note review help struggle install first figure version o x run click apple icon top leave screen click mac window pop clearly see version 10xy generally able ignore value instead pay close attention 10x portion * amazon disallow link nonamazon page try descriptive possible version 109 google norton antivirus downloads without quote click result directs norton site search page find trial version norton antivirus link want within section site norton free trial want click link say norton antivirus 30day free trial mac follow click big yellow button actually begin download install plug license key software activate note anytime trial instead would like extra 30 day free wink_or_smirk
"the real staying power in a game like titanfall or call of duty is the multiplayer game. naturally since the consensus multiplayer standard bearer is the call of duty black ops series ( not the modern warfare series). i compare these types of games to it. although titanfall has lots of whistles and buzzers, it feels very limited. the maps seem large but they feel sterile. the action is so hectic and fast that there is no feel of employing strategies or tactics. it's just a in your face slugfest. now maybe it's because i am just an old gamer, but even though many of the black ops games had small maps, it had feel of maybe you could actually be there.

oddly i find i'm not excited to play this game after a long day coming home from work after  everybody goes to bed, like i was with black ops. perhaps as time goes on, further incarnations of this game will get better. however, for now, it is just ho-hum",1,game,real stay power game like titanfall call duty multiplayer game naturally since consensus multiplayer standard bearer call duty black ops series modern warfare series compare type game although titanfall lot whistle buzzer feel limit map seem large feel sterile action hectic fast feel employ strategy tactic face slugfest maybe old gamer even though many black ops game small map feel maybe could actually oddly find excited play game long day come home work everybody go bed like black ops perhaps time go incarnation game get good however hohum

"if you're either a huge fan of the megaman series or just need to blow a weekend playing your ps2, this is the game for you. otherwise, steer clear.

++visuals: 6/10++
i know they were going for something new here, combining a 2d side-scroller with a 3d platformer. but, playing through x7, i truly felt that they didn't try all that hard. for example, they didn't even animate the cutscenes. i mean, come on, people, this is 2003. other than that, though, the levels themselves are pleasant to look at with a wide range of color schemes and a little imagination to boot. plus, who ever had a difficult time looking at x? fangirl coming through...

++handling: 6/10++
the game isn't severely crippled by the camera controls or angles, but it certainly isn't enhanced either - keeping in mind that, as i said, x7 was an experimental mix and the cameras were bound to be awkward. taking that into account, i have to at least give it credit for _trying_. that doesn't mean i forgive all the lethal blind-spot moments, however. be forewarned that x7 isn't a glitch-free walk in the park.

++replay value: 4/10++
it was semi-decent the first time around, but i probably wouldn't invest another 15 hours in it, largely due to the unimaginable irritation i experienced for every time the leftmost pixel of my character's arm got nudged by the rightmost pixel of an enemy, pushing me off an edge as well as paralyzing me momentarily, and then causing me to start the entire level over. sorry, x, but i've gotta be fair.

++overall rating: 5/10++
as i said, x7 is decent - good for kicks and giggles - but not the best in the series or even the best i've played in the last few months. the characters are stock, the voice acting is typically laughable, the plotline is non-existant, and the controls' and visuals' positive points are hardly a saving grace...if anything, i recommend megaman x4 in x7's place; it's personally one of my all-time favorites, and incidentally largely follows the same lines as x7, though it's better produced...and the cut-scenes are animated. imagine that.",1,game,either huge fan megaman series need blow weekend play ps2 game otherwise steer clear ++visuals 610++ know go something new combine 2d sidescroller 3d platform playing x7 truly felt try hard example even animate cutscenes mean come people 2003 though level pleasant look wide range color scheme little imagination boot plus ever difficult time look x fangirl come ++handling 610++ game severely cripple camera control angle certainly enhance either keep mind say x7 experimental mix camera bound awkward take account least give credit _trying_ mean forgive lethal blindspot moment however forewarn x7 glitchfree walk park ++replay value 410++ semidecent first time around probably would invest another 15 hour largely due unimaginable irritation experience every time leftmost pixel character arm get nudged rightmost pixel enemy push edge well paralyze momentarily cause start entire level sorry x get ta fair ++overall rating 510++ say x7 decent good kick giggle best series even best play last month character stock voice act typically laughable plotline nonexistant control visual positive point hardly save graceif anything recommend megaman x4 x7 place personally one alltime favorites incidentally largely follow line x7 though good producedand cutscenes animate imagine

"this game is fun, especially if you're a simpsons' fan. basically, you race around springfield as one of up to 17 characters and in one of six locations, picking up people and racing to drop them off somewhere else on time, sometimes avoiding hitting other cars, sometimes trying to devastate the town to earn extra time and money. as you earn money by driving people around, you unlock the locations and characters. there are also some missions in which you basically try to run over a certain number of objects in a certain span of time.  the ultimate goal is to earn a million dollars (about 100 attempts) to run mr. burns' nuclear buses out of business.
the game is quite fun out of the box. apparently, the actors recorded speech for the game and the quips are amusing (if occasionally non sequiturs).  the cars are amusing and springfield is amazingly detailed. for a fan, it's especially entertaining as it contains a lot of side references to the series that you will appreciate if you are a devotee.  those not terribly fluent in the simpsons will still like it (you wouldn't be buying it if you didn't like the show) but won't appreciate the little details a simpson's nutcase (like myself) will.
however, the fun wears off rather quickly. the game is repetitive. and the victory animation is disappointing.  the missions are especially poor - you figure out what path to take in order to complete the mission in the alloted time, then keep doing it over and over (and over) again until you get it right. bor-ing!

"there is a bit of a learning curve to getting your license to activate correctly for this offer.  i'm going to crib a bit that helped me from another amazon reviewer's comments for those in need of the info:

""go to:  https://app.avg.com/us-en/code

paste in the code amazon gave you.
-note: make sure you have setup a myavg account. if you haven't then go here first: https://myaccount.avg.com/ and setup an account with the email address you want everything connected through.

scroll down to the bottom and hit ""activate now"".
-it should then give you the option to download for all the various devices this thing covers. i had been using the 30 day free trial so i was able to skip that download step. if you haven't been using the free trial then go ahead and download it from here. if you have used the free trial then move onto the next step.

go to your already installed avg zen and at the top right of the screen look for the connect button which is right next to the messages button. in my case that shows the email address the account is setup through. it showed ""connected"" after i did the update because of the trial i'd been using so click on that and choose to logout. you'll need to refresh your login for zen to recognize your new license.

it should now give you the option to log back in. be sure to select the option to login with a myavg account. use the exact credentials you used when you registered your license.

now that you are logged in it'll flash a few times as it connects with your account and recognizes your license. it'll say you're not protected for a moment as it switches from your free trial to your license. be patient for a moment and let the program do its thing as it updates.

restart your computer and when it comes back up you should be good to go.""

i'm a little bit mystified that this is such a convoluted process when previous virus scan purchases via amazon were as simple as plugging in a registration code and being off to the races, but it's ultimately something that can be fixed.  just be aware that you may need to restart your computer even after activating your license and connecting your account before the software refreshes to reflect your ""paid up"" status.

avg free is a mainstay for friends who need virus protection but don't have much cash to throw around for a proper paid program.  the continued availability of a free option from avg keeps them on my favored list and i only spent a year away from their product line due to finding a better price on webroot.  given that this is $19.99 as of my writing, it's kind of a no-brainer to return to the avg fold.  after all, i'd been using it in various formats for around 4 years prior to defecting to the now more expensive (and somewhat more invasive) webroot software.

"i did a couple weeks worth of research to find a bag that could expand when i bought additional games and controllers. best buy and other places  (including amazon) have the wii sling bag made by nintendo. although it is a slick looking bag, its incredibly small and seemingly impractical for anyone who wants to bring more than 1-2 controllers and the console itself.

not only was the size an initial issue, but the price was about the same or a little more expensive than the g-pak in most cases.

upon receiving the g-pak i could immediately see i got more than i expected for my money. its a tough well made pack with enough room for over two dozen games, the system, controllers and additional small items.

the way the top opens up with the console secure inside makes it easy for traveling. if you want to bring 3-4 controllers with you it will be a tiny bit tight (with nunchucks and all,) but as long as your not too sensitive about controllers touching during the time it takes you to get to where your going.

my suggestions are to always make sure you remove the batteries for the controllers before traveling with them.

"i took the plunge and did the $14.99 update option offered by microsoft. i absolutely regret it. i can see how the new modern ui would be great for a touch screen or tablet, but for a desktop (especially a multi-monitor one) the ui is completely anti-productivity. i had to download third party software to disable the 'charm bar,' hotcorners, and force a start-button back onto the desktop. doing all this, i basically turned the os back into windows 7.

there's a ton of little annoyances -- for example the ability to change the color of the text and min/max/close buttons on the titlebar has been removed for seemingly no reason.

if you're avid to test, i'd advise doing a search for ""windows upgrade offer,"" which should let you try without spending too much.

"as many of the reviews have already established; global agenda is not a traditional mmo... or shooter but it is a good bit of fun.  i have to say that i went into the game with low expectations due to some mixed reviews i read on a couple of game sites but i was pleasantly surprised by both the game and the community.

i am not going to go into the specifics of the game since other reviews have already done that but instead will offer this advice:  get the trial, play it a few hours and then decide for yourself, but really play it for at least two or three hours and be sure to team up with some other players.  it really changed the whole experience for me.  i was fortunate and teamed up with a marine stationed overseas who had been playing a while and i ended up joining his agency (guild).  he was friendly and went out of his way to ""show me the ropes"".  i found that he was more typical of the global agenda community than an exception.

as of now the game is ""free to play"" which means when you buy it you can play it as much as you like and all content is free.  there was some content that required a fee early on but no longer.  with the game on sale it is certainly worth the price.  additionally if you want to level fast you can buy a booster pack which will give you double xp and double drops.  it is a quick way to level.  have played a lot of 40+ dollar games that were much less fun.

did detract one star from the overall rating of the game because there was no obvious in-game help and it was easy to sit around wondering what you were supposed to do next.  fortunately the community is helpful.",0,game,many review already establish global agenda traditional mmo shooter good bit fun say go game low expectation due mixed review read couple game sit pleasantly surprised game community go go specific game since review already do instead offer advice get trial play hour decide really play least two three hour sure team player really change whole experience fortunate team marine station overseas playing end join agency guild friendly go way show rope find typical global agenda community exception game free play mean buy play much like content free content require fee early longer game sale certainly worth price additionally want level fast buy booster pack give double xp double drop quick way level play lot 40+ dollar game much less fun detract one star overall rating game obvious ingame help easy sit around wonder suppose next fortunately community helpful

"this game is fantastic.  my family loves the dog island game and have taken three different dogs through the entire game.  while this is a one player game, it is just as fun watching and strategizing with the one playing as it is to play it.  we have enjoyed helping each other go through some of the more challenging portions (each one of us has a strength).  we played about 2-3 weeks (a little at a time) on this game to get through all the challenges and collect all the items.

the concept is simple but with challenge. because of the amount of reading and the ""scary snakes"" it isn't as easy for younger kids (7 and below).  i think ages 8 and up is perfect for this game - my 8 and 10 year olds love this game  and i too - a mother in her 40s.  this game is not violent and there is no blood, but when the snakes and bulls and bears get a ""mad"" face and attempt to ""bite"" you (no violence here) this can be scary (and difficult) for younger players.  the graphics of the dogs are cute and the younger ones like changing the hats and clothes of the dogs and fishing and swimming.  the different worlds are fun too.

the mini games within add a fun challenge as well.  the quests are challenging enough but not too challenging to become frustrating.

if you like longer quest games that aren't too tough but challenging and cute characters and don't mind doing some reading this game is for you.  we love it and hope there is a dog island 2 coming.",0,game,game fantastic family love dog island game take three different dog entire game one player game fun watch strategizing one playing play enjoy help go challenging portion one u strength play 23 week little time game get challenge collect item concept simple challenge amount read scary snake easy young kid 7 think age 8 perfect game 8 10 year old love game mother 40 game violent blood snake bull bear get mad face attempt bite violence scary difficult young player graphic dog cute young one like change hat clothes dog fish swim different world fun mini game within add fun challenge well quest challenge enough challenge become frustrate like long quest game tough challenge cute character mind reading game love hope dog island 2 come

"this is my first da game that i've ever played, and i've gotta say - i love it.  i've played through it a couple times as different races and genders, just so i could play through the interpersonal aspects and see the differences - and the romance options are fun too!  i wish you could do more with your inner circle of peeps, but with what's available to do, it's still a lot of fun.

the gameplay, while occasionally glitchy, is fun and easy to use.  the graphics, especially considering the release date, are pretty fantastic, even if the character movement comes across as somewhat... awkwardly stiff, but that's more amusing than annoying anyway.  i think the biggest thing i wish was included was bigger consequences, i guess.  like, if you do or say something that 'disappoints' one of your buddies, there's no downfall from that, and there's no way to know exactly how much or little all of the peeps in your inner circle like you - it makes it seem like that should be a possibility, what with all the ""cassandra approves/disapproves/greatly disapproves"" nonsense.  but maybe that'll be different in the next game.  regardless, it's still a fun game to play.

you can waste so many hours of your nonexistent life on this game, and not regret it one bit.  i'd recommend playing this game outside of your comfort zone - like, if you always play a female human warrior, try playing a male dwarven mage, just to spice it up a bit.  trust me, it's all good times, no matter who or how you play.",0,game,first da game ever play get ta say love played couple time different race gender could play interpersonal aspect see difference romance option fun wish could inner circle peep available still lot fun gameplay occasionally glitchy fun easy use graphic especially consider release date pretty fantastic even character movement come across somewhat awkwardly stiff amuse annoy anyway think big thing wish include big consequence guess like say something wouldisappoints one buddy downfall way know exactly much little peeps inner circle like make seem like possibility cassandra approvesdisapprovesgreatly disapprove nonsense maybe different next game regardless still fun game play waste many hour nonexistent life game regret one bit would recommend play game outside comfort zone like always play female human warrior try play male dwarven mage spice bit trust good time matter play

"i'm in charge of keeping 5 computers healthy and bug-free (two at home, 3 at work), so i am always on the lookout for easy programs that work quietly in the background to keep them all working well.

all my computers are currently running this setup:
avira antivir personal (free edition at home, paid at work)
windows defender (free)
cc cleaner  (free)
ad aware (free)
auslogics disk defrag (free)
eusing free registry cleaner (free)
spybot - search & destroy (free)

some of these programs run in the background and offer protection (avira, windows defender).  the others i run about once a month, more frequently if we're adding or removing lots of programs.

in testing spyware doctor, i used my laptop as the first guinea pig.  initially i booted the computer up and measured the time it took - just under a minute.  without running any regular scans, i uninstalled all the above named products, and re-booted twice, again checking the time it took - again just under a minute.

i installed spyware doctor and did two boots - checking the clock on the second boot - startup now takes nearly 3 minutes.

i updated spyware doctor and ran a full scan.  the doctor caught 7 groups of items, 1 'critical' and the rest 'negligible'.  after checking through the list, i determined that many of the negligibles were cookies i wanted to keep.  i de-selected these and had the doctor clean the rest.

next, i re-installed my regular regimen of free programs.  running ad-aware, cc cleaner and spybot gleaned a total of more than 70 items that spyware doctor missed.  there were two critical items and the rest were just cookies and other junk that gets dumped on our computers when we surf the net.  not really security issues but not necessary either.

for the next test, i moved to my desktop at home.  this has the same regimen of free programs.  i ran all those programs first, finding and deleting about 40 items in all.  i uninstalled the freeware and installed spyware doctor.  startup times again increased by about 45 seconds to 1 minute.  i ran spyware doctor, which found 4 negligibles that were cookies i wanted to keep.

so, is spyware doctor a good product?  yes, it does a decent job of finding and removing junk.  it is simple to use and is a great option for people who don't want to worry about an active defense.

would i recommend it to everyone?  no.  if you are willing to spend a few minutes a month running a couple of free programs, you will have slightly better results and your computer will boot up and run faster.  you will save money.

it's up to the individual user to decide which category they fall in.  if you are willing to take some effort, go for the free programs.  if you don't want the hassle, purchase spyware doctor.",1,software,charge keep 5 computer healthy bugfree two home 3 work always lookout easy program work quietly background keep work well computer currently run setup avira antivir personal free edition home pay work window defender free cc clean free ad aware free auslogics disk defrag free eus free registry clean free spybot search & destroy free program run background offer protection avira window defender other run month frequently add remove lot program test spyware doctor use laptop first guinea pig initially boot computer measure time take minute without run regular scan uninstalled name product reboot twice check time take minute instal spyware doctor two boot check clock second boot startup take nearly 3 minute update spyware doctor run full scan doctor catch 7 group item 1 critical rest negligible check list determine many negligibles cooky want keep deselected doctor clean rest next reinstall regular regimen free program run adaware cc clean spybot glean total 70 item spyware doctor miss two critical item rest cooky junk get dumped computer surf net really security issue necessary either next test move desktop home regimen free program run program first find delete 40 item uninstalled freeware instal spyware doctor startup time increase 45 second 1 minute run spyware doctor find 4 negligibles cooky want keep spyware doctor good product yes decent job find remove junk simple use great option people want worry active defense would recommend everyone willing spend minute month run couple free program slightly well result computer boot run faster save money individual user decide category fall willing take effort go free program want hassle purchase spyware doctor

"years ago i used quicken 2003.  it worked perfectly.  no issues at all, the ui was good and easy to navigate.  no bugs at all.

since i had such a good experience in the past i figured all the negative reviews here must just be people that either are just mad at the world or incompetent.  sadly they are correct.  the checkbook register works ok, but ok is all, i definitely wouldn't say well.  some of the many problems i encountered trying to get it setup (and before i gave up on it) are below:

1) account data download goes as far back as there is history for.  but for my 3 accounts with a nationwide bank they were all different date ranges.  checking went back 86 days, savings 72 and credit card 38 days.  there was no option to choose how much historical data to import, or to prevent it from importing the historical data.  the checking account data that was imported as at least 50% mis-categorized if not more.  i would have rather just started from the setup day going forward but that was not an option.

2) loan accounts.  when creating a loan (and an asset for it) you only are given a place to enter that starting info.  i entered my 7 year old mortgage starting info.  but i can't put ""today's"" balance anywhere.  i had to do a manual adjustment to get it to where it is today, but that throws all of the numbers in the reports off.  i had the exact same issue with a car loan.

3) assets and liabilities are very confusing.  they are linked together, which on the surface makes sense, but trying to link multiple liabilities to 1 asset was a nightmare.

4) the main page shows all your account balances to the left.  in theory a great feature, but you can't customize it.  personally i'd like to be able to choose either different reports there, or at least be able to choose which accounts are included.

i had several minor issues as well that aren't worth listing individually.  overall i'm extremely disappointed.  i can see why they no longer offer a trial edition like they used to.  i certainly never would have purchased the software if i'd been able to try it out first.

i highly suggest not purchasing this product, for years quicken has been the standard, but now i think your better with any of the other options.  even an abacus would probably work better for tracking personal finances...  i did make sure i had all of the updates installed, and after spending a week trying to get it all to work properly i have given up.  buyer beware!",2,software,year ago use quicken 2003 work perfectly issue ui good easy navigate bug since good experience past figure negative review must people either mad world incompetent sadly correct checkbook register work ok ok definitely would say well many problem encounter try get setup give 1 account data download go far back history 3 account nationwide bank different date range check go back 86 day saving 72 credit card 38 day option choose much historical data import prevent import historical data check account data import least 50 % miscategorized would rather started setup day go forward option 2 loan account create loan asset give place enter start info enter 7 year old mortgage start info put today balance anywhere manual adjustment get today throw number report exact issue car loan 3 asset liabilities confuse link together surface make sense try link multiple liability 1 asset nightmare 4 main page show account balance leave theory great feature customize personally would like able choose either different report least able choose account include several minor issue well worth list individually overall extremely disappointed see longer offer trial edition like use certainly never would purchase software would able try first highly suggest purchase product year quicken standard think good option even abacus would probably work well track personal finance make sure update instal spending week try get work properly give buyer beware

"i find that pure total security, when it works, is very effective in protecting my system from intruders. what it needs is protection from kaspersky, whose recent performance was the messiest failure of an upgrade that i've seen in thirty-five years with personal computers.

when kaspersky attempted online upgrade of pure from version 2.0 to 3.0, the result in my system was neither upgrade nor any notice of the attempt. windows 7 said i had lost protection from intruders and led me up blind alleys for hours. my pure installation eventually said its license had expired (after less than 2 months under a 12-month license) and told me to buy a new license for 99 dollars. it was after-hours for most modes of access to kaspersky tech support.

groping in the maze at usa.kaspersky.com, i chanced upon a clue leading to a method to re-activate my license. the method restored normal operation, including upgrade, shortly before an e-mail reply from kaspersky tech-support suggested alternative procedures that might have worked too.

a week later, kaspersky notified me explicitly that my pure installation was de-activated again, without saying why, and directed me to reinstall it. i did so, a damn nuisance, but easy compared to the earlier crash. a day or two after that, microsoft did an automatic win7 update and reboot. then pure 3.0 again had no activation key and needed installation for the third time. i have no way to know whether or how the win7 update and pure 3.0 failure were related.

my suggestions to kaspersky are:
1. please test and debug updates before deploying them.
2. please kill the bugs that cause de-activation.
3. pure total security's user interface lacks logical organization. also it's overly complex and three times more verbose than necessary. guidance from usa.kaspersky.com is better--could be better still and should be unnecessary. so, please get serious about the user experience as follows.
* make up your mind about what the user needs and automate it, instead of surfeiting the user with options expressed in jargon.
* organize in a hierarchical way that makes it obvious how a user can drill down for detail if wanted.

"i know kav saved my computer from a dealy virus!!

i had nortron on my desk top pc and laptop, but on my laptop the nortron had expired. the reason i picked kav over nortron was because of all the positive post about kav not load downing the system is soo true!! when ever i'd reset my pc (rebooted it) the 1st screen that would popped up would be nortron and it would hang on that screen forever!! i use to walk away and come back 15 minutes later to see if my desk top screen was finally up & running.

i reset my pc now with kav, and it goes right to my desk top screen & is up and working in seconds. there is no big kav screen right in front of you like nortron!! and my system has been faster since nortron has been gone.

now as for kav fighting virus----my laptop had kav but my pc still had nortron i was waiting for it to exprire before putting kav on. my husband open an email on the pc & he said nortron did pop up saying ""illegal script do you want to stop"" and he hit 'stop script'. but then all these pop up adds started coming up on the screen, even though pop blocker was on!! i check all our secruity were on high, pop up blocker was on, still the pop ups would not stop, so i tried rebooting it & the system crashed!!! came up to a completely black screen it won't do anything!! no matter how many time we turn it off/on a black screen. even though we hit stop the script on nortron it still was able to load something onto our computer and crashed it.

"got these as a gift from my wife. the keys themselves are solid and beautifully made - the listing's photos appear to have some poorly-manufactured keys, but i think this must just be lighting.

i received 106 keys total - a full qwerty + numpad complement, an alternate caps lock key (so i have both a full-height caps key and a half-stepped caps key), and a green rubberized ""7"" key. my also include a ring-style keypuller and a ""tweezer""-style keypuller. this is consistent with the photos from a previous review, but that reviewer claimed this was advertised as a 115-key set at their time of purchase. when this was bought for me, it was advertised as a 105-key set (and i assume #106 is a freebie to encourage me to buy rubberized keys).

tai-hao has a reputation for making great affordable keys, but their ""nano antibiosis"" coating is a bit a polarizing topic. my keys came out of the package with some pale white discoloration and oily artifact on them. this is pretty standard for keycap sets with this coating. unfortunately, tai-hao has refused to listen to a chorus of buyers requesting this be an optional feature, but until they do, you can remove this coating with regular store-bought isopropyl alcohol & a little elbow grease. there's a great tutorial available on imgur/reddit - simply google ""taihao remove coating"". if you receive any tai-hao kit and find it to feel ""sticky"" or have discoloration, try this before sending it back and buying a more expensive kit! by all reviews and in my own experience, this fix makes a world of difference.

the keys themselves are fantastic and i'm excited to spice up my desk a bit. 5/5 stars for them.
because i needed to do some work on my own to clean these keys before they were comfortably usable, and because the listing's photos don't 100% accurately reflect what's included with the purchase, i'm giving this listing a 3/5. if these keys had come without the nano coating, the purchase would have been a 5+/5.",1,game,get gift wife key solid beautifully make list photo appear poorlymanufactured key think must light receive 106 key total full qwerty + numpad complement alternate cap lock key fullheight cap key halfstepped cap key green rubberize 7 key also include ringstyle keypuller tweezerstyle keypuller consistent photo previous review reviewer claim advertised 115key set time purchase buy advertised 105key set assume # 106 freebie encourage buy rubberized key taihao reputation make great affordable key nano antibiosis coat bit polarize topic key come package pale white discoloration oily artifact pretty standard keycap set coat unfortunately taihao refuse listen chorus buyer request optional feature remove coat regular storebought isopropyl alcohol & little elbow grease great tutorial available imgurreddit simply google taihao remove coat receive taihao kit find feel sticky discoloration try send back buy expensive kit review experience fix make world difference key fantastic excited spice desk bit 55 star need work clean key comfortably usable list photos 100 % accurately reflect include purchase give list 35 key come without nano coating purchase would 5+5

my advice after 25 years in the industry ? for antivirus, get mcafee internet suite ! it includes a firewall, better auto updates of virus definitions than anyone else out there, plus a spam killer and a privacy tool for your web browsing.

"i'm an old time quicken user who switched to ms money for a few years.  once microsoft stopped supporting money i naturally returned to quicken.  i must say, ms may not produce the best software overall, but money was far far superior to quicken.

our checking account has absolutely never had a negative balance, but quicken not only projects it to go below $0 next month, it projects its balance to go deeper and deeper below $0 every month.

quicken fails to automatically match my automatic bills to transactions already in my register.  when it doesn't find a match it doesn't allow me to manually select the matching transaction.  how basic is that?

quicken insists on using its own categories for downloaded transactions, even if i've deleted their silly category names. e.g., who needs food and dining:fast food?  isn't it all dining?  if you like that category, fine.  i don't, so quicken needs to remember that i changed all those transactions to simply use my existing dining category, especially considering i deleted their category.

my mortgage payment is automatically entered every month, which is nice.  however, quicken has yet to figure out how to categorize the payment, so every month i must manually assign a category to the interest.  i guess this is better than having quicken continually assign the wrong category.

when performing account updates quicken will randomly crash.  it will also pop up the password vault screen behind other active windows, so for an instant i believe it to have crashed.

when manually updating my investment values, the screen flickers many times as quicken updates the values on the screen.

quicken has horrible mutual fund management capabilities.  i've abandoned management of our ira's and other mutual fund accounts and simply enter the total value once per month.  not only does quicken not talk to our providers (tiaa-cref and ameriprise), but it's much too tedious manually entering all those transactions whenever our automatic contribution is taken from our paycheck.

and the list goes on...

"first, there are a couple of corrections i'd like to post regarding a review of dec 26.  the review has 2 major errors that i could not leave alone:
- power management has changed.  apm is the former package that supported power management (i.e. laptops).  it is still included in suse for older hardware support.  acpi is the new kid on the block, and is installed on newer hardware.  it does have a bug that, fortunately, can be resolved easily...
- star office is no longer in suse.  that is correct.  the review fails to mention that star office is a sun microsystems' commercial product.  it is based on an open source project named open office.  the source code and functionalities are almost identical.  open office 'is' included in suse.  so, in essence, all that changed from suse version 8.0 to 8.1 with that office application, is the name on the icon.
now, for my own review:  suse linux 8.1 offered me what i wanted, as did prior versions.  since i've upgraded to 8.1, i replaced quicken for windows with gnucash.  i had, during my 8.0 upgrade, replaced photoshop 5.0 with gimp.  as for administering the application, don't take the yast application lightly - it rocks!!! i rarely update or customize my linux without it.  redhat, on the other hand, offered (i stopped using it at around version 7.0) sereral little applications to customize the installed base.  the problem was to remember which did what!
there are a couple of books bundled with suse 8.1.  there were 3 in 8.0.  in my opinion, they need to reduce it to one.  there is some redundant content across the 2.  they do work fine though.  if you are neither willing to read some software literature and comfortable installing an operating system, then linux is not for you just yet - if ever.  there are a few decisions along the installation process that you must make.  windows, on the other hand, doesn't have as many because the options don't exist.  i.e. type of system you want (server, half-server, client, password mgmt, disk layout, users, ...)  don't be scared, it only takes about 30 minutes on a computer that you wish to save nothing, or up to an hour or 2 if you wish to not remove your current windows installation - mostly unattended installation procedures.
i recommend suse to anyone that has installed windows a couple (few) times in the past, or feels comfortable differenciating beteen an operating system and an application.  linux is a bit more complex for the new user, and a whole lot more useable for the experienced.  i'd never switch back.",0,software,first couple correction would like post regard review dec 26 review 2 major error could leave alone power management change apm former package support power management ie laptop still include suse old hardware support acpi new kid block instal new hardware bug fortunately resolve easily star office longer suse correct review fail mention star office sun microsystems commercial product base open source project name open office source code functionalities almost identical open office include suse essence change suse version 80 81 office application name icon review suse linux 81 offer want prior version since upgraded 81 replace quicken window gnucash 80 upgrade replace photoshop 50 gimp administer application take yast application lightly rock rarely update customize linux without redhat hand offer stop use around version 70 serer little application customize installed base problem remember couple book bundle suse 81 3 80 opinion need reduce one redundant content across 2 work fine though neither willing read software literature comfortable instal operating system linux yet ever decision along installation process must make window hand many option exist ie type system want server halfserver client password mgmt disk layout user scar take 30 minute computer wish save nothing hour 2 wish remove current window installation mostly unattended installation procedure recommend suse anyone instal windows couple time past feel comfortable differenciating beteen operate system application linux bit complex new user whole lot useable experience would never switch back

"i got this game about two weeks after release.  during a week of playing i have experienced no lag or game crashes at peek weekday and weekend times.
the game itself is extremely fun, entertaining, and fresh.  the ""newbie"" soloing stage can be finished within a span of 5 to 10 hours of game play - during which time you can learn the controls, mission and combat knowledge, and all them other things.
past the beginning, one mission will take you to a battle zone - mostly probably perez park. at that point you will join a group.  this is where the game shines.  group combat can be best described as fast paced adrenalin pumping action.  much like the fighting you would expect from a comic book scenario.  in terms of eq, try to remember orc hill in greater faydark - way back in the day - but with superior graphics and player abilities diversity.
in coh, obtaining a group is extremely easy - it is surprising that this fundamental feature is not present in all new games.  eq was the first to stumble on the ""easy of obtaining a group"" problem, and was the first to address it.  their first attempts to make grouping easier led them to create group friendly in game search engines.  this however was only half the solution.  with the addition of adventures, the environment itself was readjusted to make grouping a natural process, and to a large degree the problem was solved.  coh followed this two-step design perfectly, and imbedded the eq ideology unto itself.
the game now is in a great beginning state.  there is enough simplicity for game balance, and enough diversity for diversity sake.  if you are a mmorpg fan you should definitely give this game a try.",0,game,get game two week release week playing experience lag game crash peek weekday weekend time game extremely fun entertain fresh newbie solo stage finish within span 5 10 hour game play time learn control mission combat knowledge thing past begin one mission take battle zone mostly probably perez park point join group game shine group combat best describe fast paced adrenalin pump action much like fight would expect comic book scenario term eq try remember orc hill great faydark way back day superior graphic player ability diversity coh obtain group extremely easy surprising fundamental feature present new game eq first stumble easy obtain group problem first address first attempt make group easy lead create group friendly game search engines however half solution addition adventure environment readjust make group natural process large degree problem solve coh follow twostep design perfectly imbed eq ideology unto game great begin state enough simplicity game balance enough diversity diversity sake mmorpg fan definitely give game try

"purchased this version of family tree heritage (fth) to replace my 2002 version of ftm.  for the money it is full of features, separate data files for text, multimedia and, photos which i use frequently. this makes any data corruption of files less tragic.  don't forget to backup often anyway.  if you use any other geneology software, learning to navigate this program does not take long.  plenty of buttons to click and pull down screens for adding all kinds of information and source notes.

the biggest gripe i have is no printable manual.  yes, they do include a pdf manual with the program but it only prints on 8-1/2 by 3-1/2 paper and not on 8-1/2 by 11: if you do print on letter size paper, the text is small and hard to read: a total waist of ink and paper.  i had to print the whole manual one page at a time, enlarge each page to letter size text then copy each page in back-to-back book style: a real hassle  when all they needed to do is make it print on standard paper.  guess they don't want anyone to really read this stuff.

suddenly, i am getting an error message (hookerr_nonotifywindow) that won't allow me to use it any longer in my online course. i tried everything suggested on the website and nothing worked. i emailed a simple question to tech support and received a pro forma response saying that my warranty was expired and i would have to pay for any assistance.

so, if the software stops doing what it's supposed to do, there is no fix and no one will even respond to an email unless you pay them. i understand having to pay for extended help after a warranty expires; that's reasonable. however, to refuse to answer a simple question without charging you is inexcusable!

nuance has been sending me email after email about upgrading to the next version, and i was seriously considering it because i liked the program so much. now, they can forget it! if they won't support the product even in a minimal way, why should i spend more money?

1.) survival period isn't the same. you don't do tasks; you form alliances. (alliances that last per-episode, you pick someone to ask/offer, and the bigger the alliance grows, the more trust that grows. much better interaction.)

you can only play as jury-merge people. [stinks], huh?
now... for the best parts of the game.
back in the first game, you could only play multiplayer when you connected directly to an ip. now... you can use gamespy arcade (which is included) to play online, with people you don't know. (making the interaction wayyy better; almost like you're really playing survivor!)
tribal council, better. jeff probst actually *reads* the votes now; rather than ""colby. ramona. colby. colby. colby. colby. the tribe has spoken."" he reads them!
you can skip through the many animated videos. (including; the vote-off, people voting, and the torch being snuffed.)
and let me just mention, the challenges...
rock!
they're absolutely fabulous.
just a lil review. i would definitely reccomend purchasing this game; 19.99+ isn't that much to pay for such a great quality game.

"as an amateur astronomer who has experience using a great variety of astronomy/planetarium software, i eagerly awaited the release of redshift 4.  one or two of the features i had requested in correspondence to the developer were to be included in this release.  in my opinion, redshift 4 shares very little with its wonderful predecessor, redshift 3.  though you have more options and improved control in selecting what you wish to see regarding deepsky objects, limiting magnitudes, object labels, zoom levels, etc., it all gets lost in a very cumbersome interface that leaves you frustrated and willing to compromise.
two other areas where i found the software very below expectations were in having to open or create a work session, or event screen to begin, and in the printed sky charts.  at least with my equipment, stars on the printed charts appeared the same size whether they were magnitude 2 or magnitude 6.  not good for starhopping or use as finder charts at all!.
in the redshift legacy, i am so grateful i retained redshift 3.  though support has dwindled for this release (when i last checked, piranha publishing and maris multimedia were no longer providing updates for new comets and asteroids - you may want to check for yourself), redshift 3 still ranks as premiere astronomy software which is useful at just about every level (wish it had eyepiece and telrad fov indicators).  where it is unsurpassed however, is in its fun and educational factors.  it's hard to find a better program to learn the sky and the awesome hobby of astronomy.",1,software,amateur astronomer experience use great variety astronomyplanetarium software eagerly await release redshift 4 one two feature request correspondence developer include release opinion redshift 4 share little wonderful predecessor redshift 3 though option improve control select wish see regard deepsky object limit magnitude object label zoom level etc get lose cumbersome interface leave frustrate willing compromise two area find software expectation open create work session event screen begin print sky chart least equipment star print chart appear size whether magnitude 2 magnitude 6 good starhopping use finder chart redshift legacy grateful retain redshift 3 though support dwindle release last checked piranha publish maris multimedia longer provide updates new comet asteroid may want check redshift 3 still rank premiere astronomy software useful every level wish eyepiece telrad fov indicator unsurpassed however fun educational factor hard find good program learn sky awesome hobby astronomy

"over g is a game i have been looking forward to for quite some while. when it first arived, i was excited to play a next generation flight sim, and was given something that fell short of my expectations.

sound- even with my 5.1 turned up, the jet's feel incredibly quiet, outside of the aircraft, afterburners sound weak, and the jets overall sound very quiet. the japanese rock music is nauseating, and the dialog is terrible.

graphics- the graphics are a mixed bag, while your own aircraft and your wingmans look next-gen, with dynamic shine, realistic parts and movements, and high detail, enemy aircraft are severly lacking, they almost look like something from ps1. also, multiplayer aircraft models are not as smooth or as sharply rendered as your own, this may be to save bandwith during online dogfighting, but detracts from the experiance if you are flying in formation, etc. massive draw distances and thousands of trees, buildings and nicely rendered water help over g, but ground textures get severly muddied and blurred close up, obviously not made for nap of the earth flying. taito could easily have pushed the graphics to the limit, but fell severly short, tapping barely any of the 360's potential.

multiplayer- lack of split screen is a big draw back for over g, and the online modes are lacking custimization. also, once you complete a sortie online, you cannot stay with the group you played. arena and dogfight modes get repetetive, dogfight mode is usually over before it starts, with most players using the f-22.

gameplay- this is what saves over-g in my opinion. if you are looking for an ace-combat style arcade shooter, this game will not fulifly any of your desires. over-g trys to keep it real, with realistic weapon load-outs, stalls, fully functional instrumentation, physics that closely resemble the aircraft they are portraying plus carrier and land based take off and landings.

"i pvped (player versus other players) as a warlock in the burning crusade. i just bought this game this week on sale for $30. i subscribed for $15. my class has been completely abandoned in the area i love to play the most. to make matters worse my only other high level class is a 55 rogue.

just so you know it takes around 80 hours of questing to level from 60-70, and another 80 to level from 70-80. with that in mind i have put a lot of leveling investment in my character to see it very imbalanced and not a very good class in this expansion.

to give you an example of my class, it is like bringing a knife to a fight with automatic rifles, whereas my warlock is the idiot with the knife.

the sad thing is that blizzard has never been able to balance the game in a way that everyone can feel satisfied, that everyone can feel their class has an edge and a purpose in the game. what i think blizzard's goal is to have you level a class to 80, then make the class almost completely useless at everything you would like it to be, leaving you with no choice but to start leveling again from scratch. again, countless hours go into getting these characters to the max level.

words of advice: take your time, enjoy it, and exit the game when real life calls no matter what.",1,game,pvped player versus player warlock burn crusade buy game week sale $ 30 subscribe $ 15 class completely abandon area love play make matter bad high level class 55 rogue know take around 80 hour quest level 6070 another 80 level 7080 mind put lot level investment character see imbalanced good class expansion give example class like bring knife fight automatic rifle whereas warlock idiot knife sad thing blizzard never able balance game way everyone feel satisfied everyone feel class edge purpose game think blizzard goal level class 80 make class almost completely useless everything would like leave choice start level scratch countless hour go get character max level word advice take time enjoy exit game real life call matter

wp still excels at professional formatting and ease of operation.  ms office gets tangled up in its own fancy formatting, and cannot easily move text from one document to another (or from one format to another) without failing on formatting.  you cannot beat wordperfect's ""reveal codes"" as a way to clean up formatting clutter!!

wp x6 is trying to adopt ms office 2010 functionality and not succeeding - while i like multiple windows (rather than working with multiple documents within one frame), wpx6 loses its ""recently opened"" file list if you don't open every file from within x6 - completely missing the opportunities afforded by windows 7 to search and access files from within win7.

ms powerpoint is the leader in the slide show market.  with the exception of the inability to automatically create random transitions (a weird shortfall, imho), the ability to create, organize, flow, embed video and sound, set slide transition timing and export to a video format have turned powerpoint into a very nice all-purpose media tool.  by comparison, x6 presentations is clunky and awkward.

the respective spreadsheets from x6 versus ms2010 are true to their roots - both maintain their native codes and formatting.  because i ""grew up"" with quattro pro, i have never liked nor gotten used to excel - i can move much faster in qp simply due to familiarity.

unfortunately for wp, i seriously considered not upgrading from x5 to x6.  the only reason i decided to spend the money is in hopes of seeing some compatibility issues and file-handling awkwardness fixed.  sadly, that didn't happen in x6, so i cannot think of a reason to upgrade from x5 to x6, and i may never purchase another upgrade.

ms office service lies in its extremely robust and user-friendly knowledge base and the well-rounded user forums.  i have never had trouble figuring out how to do something in ms office - a simple online search generates multiple options.

corel suffers in the service department - they have a typical knowledge base that is not very user-friendly, and a very annoying call-in support line (assuming you don't have to pay for it).  if you require hand-holding, x6 is not the product for you.

as a professional, i have used open office (no longer supported by oracle or sun microsystems, but let loose in the wild as an open source platform), ms office and wordperfect office.  i use word perfect for most word-processing, powerpoint for all slideshows, and use excel and quattro pro somewhat interchangeably, depending on what i'm doing and what i might be starting with.  for a new user, i recommend ms office as the most ""newby-friendly"" software.  for a professional or experienced user, i recommend x6 as the software that yields the most professional results with the least amount of time fussing with formatting.",1,software,wp user since do day regularly upgraded product new version come along last version wpx5 ms office 2010 would never consider look ms office alternative unfortunately wp compatibility issue struggle m office 2010 finally put product professional work line two product get blurry wp still excel professional formatting ease operation m office get tangle fancy format easily move text one document another one format another without fail format beat wordperfect reveal code way clean formatting clutter wp x6 try adopt ms office 2010 functionality succeed like multiple window rather work multiple document within one frame wpx6 lose recently open file list open every file within x6 completely miss opportunity afford window 7 search access file within win7 ms powerpoint leader slide show market exception inability automatically create random transition weird shortfall imho ability create organize flow embed video sound set slide transition time export video format turn powerpoint nice allpurpose medium tool comparison x6 presentation clunky awkward respective spreadsheet x6 versus ms2010 true root maintain native code format grow quattro pro never like gotten use excel move much faster qp simply due familiarity unfortunately wp seriously consider upgrading x5 x6 reason decide spend money hop see compatibility issue filehandling awkwardness fix sadly happen x6 think reason upgrade x5 x6 may never purchase another upgrade m office service lie extremely robust userfriendly knowledge base wellrounded user forum never trouble figure something ms office simple online search generates multiple option corel suffers service department typical knowledge base userfriendly annoy callin support line assume pay require handhold x6 product professional use open office longer support oracle sun microsystems let loose wild open source platform m office wordperfect office use word perfect wordprocessing powerpoint slideshows use excel quattro pro somewhat interchangeably depend might start new user recommend m office newbyfriendly software professional experience user recommend x6 software yield professional result least amount time fuss format

"i was disappointed with roxio crunch compressor/recompressor for ipod, iphone, and appletv.  it wasn't what i expected.  it does several things that annoy me.

(1)  it doesn't compress dvds for personal use.  this is a legal problem, not roxio's.  i use handbrake.
(2)  it doesn't compress homemade movies with music bought from itunes.  the error message says use an apple product.  this is really frustrating.
(3)  while it has some simple options for recompressing such as ""automatic"", ""high"", and ""fastest"" quality, i don't like the outcome.  i found the ""high"" and ""automatic"" quality to be quite poor.  the ""fastest"" quality is better, surprisingly.  not just a little better but a lot.  why is ""fastest"" better than ""high"" quality?  i dunno.  it does not seem intuitive.
(4)  i use ""custom"" quality.  for custom quality, the options become quite complicated.  fortunately, i have a background in compression, so i am able to understand most of the options.  i would recommend that you have a decent background, too, if you want to buy/use this product.
(5)  roxio crunch is a derivative product of roxio popcorn.  i know this because when i get errors, the error messages are written for popcorn and mention popcorn by name, not crunch.  so it's confused.
(6)  i was going to recommend popcorn, but i noticed that it is getting panned, too.

the product does have some merit.  i have recompressed video avi files from my canon camera into ipod videos.  i liked that.

 i have a imac running leopard, mac os x 10.5.  if you are not using the same system, your experience could be different.

i wish i hadn't bought this product.  i would recommend handbrake (which is a free download that generally works better).  if you are still interested in roxio crunch, i would buy it on amazon as it does seem to be selling for a good price (currently, $33 and change).  i bought the product at an apple store for $50 the other week.

"of the banks i use, it wouldn't connect to two of them. also, when entering paycheck information that deposits to multiple accounts, you're forced to pick a primary account and add the others as additional deposit accounts... unfortunately the balance projections incorrectly project whatever deposit the primary account gets to every account.

so, if you have a paycheck that deposits $1000, $700 to the primary, $200 to the secondary and $100 to the tertiary, when you project balances for the secondary or tertiary accounts, they're all going to show as if they were getting $700 each paycheck. this made the scheduled bills and projected balances useless.

"this product is fantastic in terms of features and functionality. it supports templates (e.g. chamber, jazz, etc.), layers (sop, alto, ten, bass), annotations, symbols, recording from midi devices, and the list goes on and on. you can pretty much create professional-grade sheet music with this software and send it straight to the printer for publication. one of the cool features i love about it is that i can connect my keyboard with a midi-usb to my computer and record in live mode or one note at a time. using this technique, i was able to generate so many scores so easily. in short, if you are a pro, looking for advanced scoring or composition, consider this.

the only reason i am not giving this product five stars is because, i find the interaction a bit difficult on windows. for instance, windows innately allows selection using the mouse-press, drag, and release. this works differently in sibelius. also, simply clicking on the score often does not result in the desired outcomes - for instance, if your score requires 8ths, quarters, and dotted notes, you will have to get used to using the panel before you get this to work correctly, otherwise, every click results in an extra note being added...in fact, despite several months of experience, i still make this mistake. another peeve of mine is that the notes panel offers a very limited array of notes and symbols. it contains many guitar-based symbols, but basic symbols, such as the slur, are not present. one has to look for them in a different menu for these symbols.

in the end, i strongly recommend this product since it features all essential capabilities for composition. i would however factor in the learning curve, especially if you are a windows user. if avid addresses some of these usage issues on windows, i would gladly give it 5 stars.",0,software,product fantastic term feature functionality support template eg chamber jazz etc layer sop alto ten bass annotation symbols record midi device list go pretty much create professionalgrade sheet music software send straight printer publication one cool feature love connect keyboard midiusb computer record live mode one note time use technique able generate many score easily short pro look advance score composition consider reason give product five star find interaction bit difficult window instance windows innately allows selection use mousepress drag release work differently sibelius also simply click score often result desire outcome instance score require 8th quarter dot note get use use panel get work correctly otherwise every click result extra note addedin fact despite several month experience still make mistake another peeve mine note panel offer limited array note symbols contain many guitarbased symbol basic symbol slur present one look different menu symbol end strongly recommend product since feature essential capability composition would however factor learn curve especially windows user avid address usage issue window would gladly give 5 star

"ya know there's some good and there's some bad.

cons:

*you know when you hit a double in the gap or down the line, it recosheds right back to the fielders, so its hard to go for 2 or even 3 bases unless he has a slow delivery.

*the swing stick just sucks.

*when the fielders get the ball in right field very deep, and you are on third, you try to get home, but the outfielders have like super arms and it gets to the base very fast nomatter how far out you are.

*when they hit a groundball in the infield, you'd expect your infielders to charge the ball right? wrong. they sit back and wait until the ball gets to them. if it's a fast runner, they have a great chance of getting an infield single on such a routine play.

*the infielders react like they are stuck in the dirt.

pros:

*player finder helps players you are looking for and is a great source.

*home run derby's are fun. they give you 4 choices, classic, tag team, team(have to unlock), and a game where you can call your shots.

*they have different kind of season modes like, a regular season, franchise,and gm career.

*the commentary is better than normal games with jon miller and joe morgan.

*legend mode gives you a great challenge by the pitching being more difficult, and the hitting also (be careful with pitch selection and location).",1,game,ya know good bad con * know hit double gap line recosheds right back fielder hard go 2 even 3 base unless slow delivery * swing stick suck * fielder get ball right field deep third try get home outfielder like super arm get base fast nomatter far * hit groundball infield would expect infielder charge ball right wrong sit back wait ball get fast runner great chance get infield single routine play * infielder react like stuck dirt pro * player finder help player look great source * home run derby fun give 4 choice classic tag team teamhave unlock game call shot * different kind season mode like regular season franchiseand gm career * commentary good normal game jon miller joe morgan * legend mode give great challenge pitch difficult hitting also careful pitch selection location
"i have played damn near every final fantasy game that has ever been released. this has to be one of the more disappointing ones, simply because it doesn't have much depth.

some people complain about square/enix moving away from the turn-based style of earlier final fantasy games, but that is not my complaint here. they are trying to modernize the look and feel of final fantasy while cutting down on the random battle encounters and tediousness of their older, trademark style. therefore, i cannot fault them for trying out new things and taking new approaches. so, despite the fact that i am a huge fan of the older style turn-base strategy element of previous ff games, i am actually not disappointed by the combat.

i'm disappointed in the story. i'm disappointed in the weak character development and the jerky, random ""story"" cut scenes that provide little to no concept of the overall arc of the story line itself. i'm disappointed that it's a band of 4 dudes running around in the car doing crappy side quests and none of them have much of a personality. and the only female character in the early part of the game is a big-boobed, half-naked grand daughter of cid that fixes up your ride. it's unfortunate how she lends no other depth to the story of her own and is relegated to this menial portrayal. it's quite pathetic, in fact, to have such a shallow female protagonist in this type of game at this stage in society. it's all too vanilla for me.

even when the main character is struggling, it's not really a struggle. he's simply trying to find this girlfriend so they can get married. big deal, right? i kept waiting for things to get interesting in this game (story-wise), but the pacing is all wrong. it feels like there is basically little urgency in taking on the main quests, because nothing is really at stake if you don't.

so, i basically just ended up riding around doing bounty hunts and fulfilling side quests to power up my party and develop my acension skills. i tricked out my chocobos with different colors and names, chased after weapon upgrade quests and weapon tombs and i even explored fishing quite a bit. while these are all great secondary attractions to the main game, there is a problem with that: nothing ever pushed me to do the main quest. i just kept ignoring it because, quite frankly, it seemed rather boring what was happening with the prince's little emo life. i can't even call him emo, because he's not even really sad that his girlfriend is not around anyway.

there are three things that make any typical final fantasy game exceptional: 1. story 2. combat 3. graphics. i put those things in my personal priority. they have accomplished #3, for sure, because graphically this is one of the best looking games you can find anywhere. #2 will divide peoples preferences, but i personally think the combat is not terrible. while it does not have much complexity to it like the days of old, it's not the worst combat system i have ever played, either. on point #1 it's a total waste of time. really, point #1 is what used to separate final fantasy games from all others. now days it seems like they have pretty much lost that magic.",1,game,play damn near every final fantasy game ever release one disappointing one simply much depth people complain squareenix move away turnbased style earlier final fantasy game complaint try modernize look feel final fantasy cut random battle encounter tediousness old trademark style therefore fault try new thing take new approach despite fact huge fan old style turnbase strategy element previous ff game actually disappointed combat disappoint story disappointed weak character development jerky random story cut scene provide little concept overall arc story line disappoint band 4 dude run around car crappy side quest none much personality female character early part game bigboobed halfnaked grand daughter cid fix ride unfortunate lends depth story relegate menial portrayal quite pathetic fact shallow female protagonist type game stage society vanilla even main character struggle really struggle simply try find girlfriend get marry big deal right keep wait thing get interesting game storywise pace wrong feel like basically little urgency take main quest nothing really stake basically end rid around bounty hunt fulfil side quest power party develop acension skill trick chocobos different color name chase weapon upgrade quest weapon tomb even explore fish quite bit great secondary attraction main game problem nothing ever push main quest kept ignore quite frankly seem rather bore happen prince little emo life even call emo even really sad girlfriend around anyway three thing make typical final fantasy game exceptional 1 story 2 combat 3 graphic put thing personal priority accomplish # 3 sure graphically one best look game find anywhere # 2 divide people preference personally think combat terrible much complexity like day old bad combat system ever play either point # 1 total waste time really point # 1 use separate final fantasy game other day seem like pretty much lose magic

"i just got this game, and finished it in a couple of days because i was playing it nonstop. it's definitely the best game i've played in a while.

for starters, the fighting is really fun. it's real time, so instead of something like pokemon where you trust to luck, you have to actually do your best. i was amazed to realize that not only were my character's stats increasing, i was actually getting better and dodging and blocking and switching weapons (swords and spears are my two favorites.) it's fun enough that the dungeons never get boring... which is good, because they're not very innovative design-wise. forging your own weapons is fun, but not particularily exciting.

secondly, the storyline is great. the basic plot - fight your way through the tournament so that you can take first place and become a craftlord - is just the beginning. while you work on that goal, tons of other stuff pops up - from fun trips to other cities with your friends to the hints of a much deeper plot. in the end, you even have a choice - fight the final battle against your rival, or help rescue your friend, even if it means possibly losing the chance to compete. the game is full of choices, which actually have an impact on your actions. why fight your way through a dungeon to find your friends when you can just let the guards capture you and take you straight there? it's up to you. but the downside is that if you're like me, you'll always wonder what you might have missed...

most importantly, the characters are great. you quickly develop a group of friends who accompany you on excursions (but sadly, never actually help you in battle...) and get to know all the adult craftlords who help you out. every night (time does indeed pass in this game - but don't worry, it has nothing to do with how much real time you spend) you get to choose a character to go talk to. the time you choose to spend with your favorite character (in my case, master sakuro =d) will affect the ending. exiting or sentimental scenes throughout the game brought tears to my eyes. i only wish that there was even more character developement, since everybody in the game seems so cool.

microsoft and amazon pr,
(rrt@waggeneredstrom.com, amazon-pr@amazon.com),

i'm planning to write an article about the ms office for mac software that ms tech support has admitted to me some of the features do not work for mac. if i can find a lawyer that's interested... or a national tv station... they will have opportunity for this story as well. at the very least... i will publish it all over the internet and social media pages.

i was on the phone nearly five hours today with microsoft, was transferred fourteen times to various departments (and countries), and was finally told that no one at microsoft could help me.

in short... i purchased ""office for mac 2011 for home and student"" and the only feature i bought it for... turning a powerpoint into a "".mov""...... produces no sound in the "".mov"".  basically giving you a slide show without sound... therefor a useless product. i bought this digital download from amazon, explained the problem to them and was told that they cannot refund because the item description they were given does not specifically say that this feature will work. they said i need to contact microsoft. after talking to ms ""tech support."", ""money back guarantee"", ""online store"", ""level 4"", ""level 3"", level 2"", i was assured that i could get a refund... but in the end was unable to. when i asked to speak to ""level 1""... i was transfered and disconnected. i left my phone number with the various departments, but they have not returned a call. i was able to manage to get a case number from tech support, and told by amazon that i may be able to get a refund.

i realize that my small purchase amount is nowhere near a fraction of what microsoft corporation is worth... but after having ms admit to me that this was their fault, their problem, and not mine nor amazon's, they still couldn't help me.

i'm willing to take the loss of this purchase price for the faulty software... but i'm not going to just forget about it. other consumers have the right to know that the software may not work for them and that they are waisting their time and money with ms products for apple mac computers.

sequels are derivative by their very nature, however, this is almost too derivative - even the 'getting used to the controls' level before the real levels start is almost identical to the one in the snes version.  the levels so far, seem to be mere rearrangements of the old levels.  no new scenery yet.

also gone are the beautiful, almost 'hand drawn' crayon, chalk, and other scribbly-type art that were so apparent in the original.  yoshi's story for the n64 carried on this tradition with it's super cool, rendered jeans-and-other-fabric pattern backgrounds.  any such cool backround are gone in yoshi's island ds.

"i have been using this controller for 3 months now and let me tell you that it is the most amazing gaming controller ever!!!

it does take some time to get used to it, but seriously, i have used a lot of game controllers on all consoles, and all kinds on pc but nothing can even near close to what this one can do. i can play literally every single game with it, shooters, platforms, strategy, races, you name it and this controller can handle it. it has so many ways you can configure it that can adapt to any play style you have and one of the best parts is that you don't even need to bother to configure it for each game, steam already have templates and configurations from both the publishers and the community that defaults per game and let you choose from them if you want a different one, or create your own and share it with the world!

there is a nice feature that i find it really handy when comes to third person games like ""resident evil 6"" which let you set the borders of the touch areas to keep scrolling with the mouse so you can turn the camera really easily and keep the touch pad precision for aiming. it also has multi modes for every single input individually that can be trigger by any button you define and let you, for example, use a high sensibility setting for the right touch pad when you are just moving and a low sensibility while aiming on shooters, or quickly switch the whole controller configuration for something more comfortable when transform in games like ""strike suit zero"" by just holding a button.

not enough buttons to match the keyboard keys? no problem, you can use multi modes to get as many button functionality as you need, even the touch pads can be used as a lot of buttons. strategy games? no problem, you can use the touch pads to navigate, set the controller buttons to the keyboard keys for quick actions and multi modes when the amount of buttons are not enough. racing games? no problem, you can use the gyroscope for steering similar to what the wii controller does while using the pressure triggers as pedals. are you left handed and would love to have a stick on the right? no problem, you can configure the right touch pad to work and feel like a joystick while the left joystick as buttons and the left touch pad as the track pad for the camera. this thing is so freaking adaptive that i started playing all my games from tv and haven't need to use my keyboard for playing games since, even for strategy games like age of empires!

you can also play non-steam games with it, therefore, you will need to add that game to your steam library (which is really easy) and start the game from it in order to take full advantage of it and have access to all it's amazing configurations.

"when our 5-year-old got into kindergarten, we were surprised to find out how much they expect out of kids that age nowadays.
just 5 years ago, when our first one was kindergarten age, they used that time to start to introduce reading concepts. now, they expect them to know the basics already and just delve into more advanced topics. even the teacher said she's still getting used to the new level they're expected to teach at.
so, we had to do outside catch-up work, and this program was right on-target. it led our kindergartener step-by-step to a firm grasp of the material - his improvement was immediately visible. and he's had so much fun that he hates to stop playing.
this is a combination of two programs that were previously separate. the first one (road to reading) goes through each letter of the alphabet and reinforces the sound of the letter, plus presents site words using that letter. the second one (word factory) picks up there and introduces how to build words from the basic sounds.
i should probably point out that this program does not include any tutorial material, so it can't be used by itself to teach a child phonics. it is, however, a great set of exercises to practice and extend what they've learned elsewhere.
i would also recommend that this be used with some amount of parental involvement. in spite of its game-like format, it should probably be treated more like homework, having an adult available to get them started and to make sure they're using each concept correctly.",0,software,5yearold get kindergarten surprise find much expect kid age nowadays 5 year ago first one kindergarten age use time start introduce read concept expect know basic already delve advanced topic even teacher say still get use new level expect teach outside catchup work program right ontarget lead kindergartener stepbystep firm grasp material improvement immediately visible much fun hat stop play combination two program previously separate first one road reading go letter alphabet reinforces sound letter plus present site word use letter second one word factory pick introduce build word basic sound probably point program include tutorial material use teach child phonics however great set exercise practice extend learn elsewhere would also recommend used amount parental involvement spite gamelike format probably treat like homework adult available get start make sure use concept correctly
"this game looked like a great showcase for the psvr, and in some ways it is; however, a few aspects left me disappointed overall with the game. when i first booted it up i loved the feeling of being perched on a building top looking around at the wonderful setting of paris over taken by nature. however, after completing the first few tutorial missions the game never really took off, the content all felt very much like a tutorial, it was not challenging or interesting at all. the world seems oddly flat, you're either on the ground or above it-- you don't get a good sense of depth of going between layers within the city. the game tries to give you the feeling you are an eagle, but i cant help feel like a drone, it's lacking something that i can't quite pin down. if i had paid $10 for this game as a downloadable title, it would have felt more appropriate, considering the depth of the content and overall presentation. my biggest problems with the game though, is that it forces a black ""tunnel vision"" onto the player when turning or flying between buildings. the edges of your screen become completely black and obstructs 30, 40, or sometimes more than 50% of your view. this was done to prevent vr motion sickness for those prone to it, and it might be a great solution for that.. but for those of us that do not get sick it completely breaks the immersion, it's distracting and there is no reason you shouldn't be able to turn it off. i've seen this feature in other games such as rigs (a game much more likely to cause motion sickness imo) and you can turn it off in the options. i could not believe that this game wouldn't allow you to do so. apparently, it bothered enough other players on the pc oculus rift version of the game that someone developed a patch to remove the tunnel vision. it was a deal-breaker for me. i did not feel immersed in eagle flight because the gameplay is shallow and the screen is constantly blacking out, ruining the experience for me. it's too bad, it seemed like a great showcase for the technology and something people of any age or background could enjoy. oh well..",2,game,game look like great showcase psvr way however aspect leave disappointed overall game first boot loved feeling perch building top look around wonderful set paris take nature however complete first tutorial mission game never really take content felt much like tutorial challenge interesting world seem oddly flat either ground get good sense depth go layer within city game try give feel eagle cant help feel like drone lack something quite pin pay $ 10 game download title would felt appropriate consider depth content overall presentation big problem game though force black tunnel vision onto player turn fly building edge screen become completely black obstructs 30 40 sometimes 50 % view do prevent vr motion sickness prone might great solution u get sick completely breaks immersion distract reason able turn see feature game rig game much likely cause motion sickness imo turn option could believe game would allow apparently bother enough player pc oculus rift version game someone develop patch remove tunnel vision dealbreaker feel immerse eagle flight gameplay shallow screen constantly black ruin experience bad seem like great showcase technology something people age background could enjoy oh well

"my purchase of jade empire was solely due to my love of bioware's best known title, knights of the old republic.  i was concerned that i might not be so engrossed without the star wars factor, but i was quickly sucked into this game.

as someone who might have only recently thought to describe herself as a gamer, i am sorely lacking in the controller skills one might expect a real-time combat system to require.  i was pleasantly surprised to find jade empire's combat more than accessible; i'd be so bold as to say i was quickly kicking major kung-fu butt :-).  seriously, the variety of styles, both in types (martial, weapon, magic and support) and the sheer number of available styles, made the fighting beautiful to see, and although there are no complex button combinations, the harmonic combinations, while never necessary to defeat an opponent, allow the player to rain especially gory death on his or her enemies.

the storyline just rocks.  the larger, overarching action constantly beckons the player to continue, and the romance subplots are one feature significantly improved over kotor, in my opinion.  both male and female pcs have more than one character available for love, and one's chosen can be converted to the pc's philosophic path, or suffer the consequences.  as (i admit it) a sappy girl when it comes to romance, i found this aspect of the game contributed significantly to my immersion in the plot.  this game can be beaten in a little over 20 hours easily, but the game experience can be significantly enriched by the many subquests.  the first time through, however, the larger plot drove me to skip several of these quests, simply because i couldn't wait to find out what happened next.

although the ""morality system"" is not perfect, i found the ways of open palm and closed fist intriguing.  there are several subquests where i felt like i was being given straight good or evil choices, but overall, the options given to the player when choosing how to deal with characters reflects divergent philosophies, rather than nice or mean options.

the most out of place element in jade empire is probably the flyer missions, although once you become immersed in this mythical world, rather than thinking of this as simply medieval china, the presence of the flyer becomes much more natural.

a large part of this game's success is definitely due to the quality voice acting.  the voices were never dull or flat, and there weren't many obviously repeated voices.  the followers' voices are just brilliant, too, particularly the more comedic characters.  and despite a slight tendency to relate large amounts of background information in random npc dialogue, the script was, on the whole, great.

overall, i absolutely loved this game.  if you're looking for a game that balances simple, yet deep player character statistics, enjoyable gameplay, stunning environments, and riveting plot, jade empire's it.",0,game,purchase jade empire solely due love bioware best known title knight old republic concern might engross without star war factor quickly suck game someone might recently think describe gamer sorely lack controller skill one might expect realtime combat system require pleasantly surprise find jade empire combat accessible would bold say quickly kick major kungfu butt happy_face_smiley seriously variety style type martial weapon magic support sheer number available style make fight beautiful see although complex button combination harmonic combination never necessary defeat opponent allow player rain especially gory death enemy storyline rock large overarch action constantly beckons player continue romance subplots one feature significantly improve kotor opinion male female pc one character available love one chosen convert pc philosophic path suffer consequence admit sappy girl come romance find aspect game contribute significantly immersion plot game beat little 20 hour easily game experience significantly enrich many subquests first time however large plot drive skip several quest simply could wait find happened next although morality system perfect find way open palm close fist intrigue several subquests felt like give straight good evil choice overall option give player choose deal character reflect divergent philosophy rather nice mean option place element jade empire probably fly mission although become immersed mythical world rather think simply medieval china presence flyer becomes much natural large part game success definitely due quality voice act voice never dull flat many obviously repeated voice follower voice brilliant particularly comed character despite slight tendency relate large amount background information random npc dialogue script whole great overall absolutely love game look game balance simple yet deep player character statistic enjoyable gameplay stun environment rivet plot jade empire

"i've always found family tree maker to be glitchy and this one is no exception. i had ftm 2011 for pc and decided to skip the latest upgrades (especially after the problems when treesync first came out) but recently bought a mac and opted to buy the latest version for mac.

i knew moving my ftm pc file to the mac would be a challenge (despite their pr saying otherwise) but it was a nightmare. it took hours of phone calls to 5 different customer service reps - 4 of them new less about ftm for mac than i did, which is saying something - and tried no less than a dozen different ways to convert the file, upload to ancestry and import and so on to get it right. the file was messed up depending on what we tried - no media files, media files but none (i had 1,500) connected to any source citations, media files connected but incorrect or missing source citation titles, media files but missing facts for many of my 2,500 people.

i will say their migration utility does not work with a family tree maker 2011 backup file (at least not in my case), which is ironic because if you have the latest ftm for pc they tell you to downgrade to ftm 2011 before using the utility.

what finally worked was sending the file to ancestry's support, which took a week to convert and send it back to me. it is way better, but still has problems - like many media files won't sync to the online tree (sometimes it's 150, sometimes its 142; no idea what files or why the number fluctuates)

using the program itself. i just mentioned the issue with tree sync. other issues:
-- it has crashed on me half a dozen times. never expected that on a mac
-- it runs slow sometimes. frankly everything else runs faster on the mac (a brand new macbook pro) so i'm disappointed to see that speed was not enhanced by leaving the pc program
-- media workspace - sometimes it's glitchy. you select someone and it jumps around. but at least the search feature works (which it didn't very well in ftm 2011). one thing i wish they'd let you do is to allow you to link multiple people to a selected media item.

one very nice thing that may be in other new editions (remember this is my first upgrade since 2011) is that if you create an event it will let you copy and paste that event in another person's record (very handy when i entered a family reunion). and it will also open a menu to allow you to select multiple people in a family group to paste that event to if desired. very handy.

would i recommend it? that's a tough one. if you use ancestry.com it really is still a great way to link your desktop tree and online and when tree sync works, it's wonderful. if you don't have ftm 2011 or you're not moving from a pc, you might not have my issues. my suggestion is if you want to take a chance, get the digital download from amazon or ancestry.com directly because it'd be easier to return it if you hate it. hopefully they'll have a few more patches to fix some of these issues.",1,software,always find family tree maker glitchy one exception ftm 2011 pc decide skip late upgrade especially problem treesync first come recently buy mac opt buy late version mac know move ftm pc file mac would challenge despite pr say otherwise nightmare take hour phone call 5 different customer service reps 4 new less ftm mac say something try less dozen different way convert file upload ancestry import get right file mess depend tried medium file medium file none 1500 connect source citation medium file connect incorrect miss source citation title medium file miss fact many 2500 people say migration utility work family tree maker 2011 backup file least case ironic late ftm pc tell downgrade ftm 2011 use utility finally work send file ancestry support take week convert send back way well still problem like many medium file sync online tree sometimes 150 sometimes 142 idea file number fluctuates use program mention issue tree sync issue crash half dozen time never expect mac run slow sometimes frankly everything els run faster mac brand new macbook pro disappointed see speed enhance leaving pc program medium workspace sometimes glitchy select someone jump around least search feature work well ftm 2011 one thing wish would let allow link multiple people select medium item one nice thing may new edition remember first upgrade since 2011 create event let copy paste event another person record handy enter family reunion also open menu allow select multiple people family group paste event desire handy would recommend tough one use ancestrycom really still great way link desktop tree online tree sync work wonderful ftm 2011 move pc might issue suggestion want take chance get digital download amazon ancestrycom directly would easier return hate hopefully patch fix issue

"i've owned and worn an old utilikilt for more than a dozen years, and having lost about 50 lbs recently and about 6 inches off my waist, i decided to get a replacement. that old kilt is made of heavy canvas, colored a dull orange, and it wears like iron, but it doesn't move or flex unless i encounter a very heavy wind to move it. because it doesn't flex, it looks very 'artificial'. i dyed it dark brown and washed it numerous times to loosen it up without much luck. my ut kilt arrived and i tried it on immediately. it's half the weight of that old kilt, perfectly stitched fits wonderfully. i intentionally bought mine just a tad loose, and the measurement they sent me was precisely what i needed. do pay attention to their size chart information. measure about one inch below your belly button with a cloth measuring tape. then i recommend that you add two inches to that measurement. my own waist is 36 inches. if i'd ordered a size 38 ut kilt, it would have been exactly the right size. however, i most often wear heavier weight shirts, so i added 4 inches to my measurement, instead of just 2 inches. it's still just a tiny bit loose, and i can easily take up the slack with my waist belt,  and with the two waist straps and buckles built into the kilt. if i gain a bit of weight, or add an inch to my waist because of holiday feasting, i'm still going to have a kilt that fits properly. if you get it too small, it will not stretch to fit! i'm 6-feet tall; the kilt is 22-inches long from top hem to bottom hem, so if you wear it properly, the bottom hem partially covers your knees. other kilts sold here on amazon tend to run 24-inches long or longer, and the shorter 22-inch length was the final factor in my decision to buy from ut kilts.the belt loops are exceptional, and the ut kilt folks also carry ab excellent 2 1/4-inch belt that is perfect for the job. however, all the celtic belt buckles listed here on amazon are configured for a 1 1/2-inch belt, and there are numerous reviews discussing that mismatch in size. so i opted to continue using the 2-inch heavy leather work belt that i've worn for years with my old kilt. it will work just fine until i can find the right buckle. i'd recommend this ut kilt to anyone who hasn't tried wearing a kilt before, and i give it two enthusiastic thumbs up for any veteran kilt wearers who are considering a purchase.",0,fashion,own worn old utilikilt dozen year lose 50 lb recently 6 inch waist decide get replacement old kilt make heavy canvas color dull orange wear like iron move flex unless encounter heavy wind move flex look artificial dyed dark brown wash numerous time loosen without much luck ut kilt arrive tried immediately half weight old kilt perfectly stitch fit wonderfully intentionally buy mine tad loose measurement sent precisely need pay attention size chart information measure one inch belly button cloth measure tape recommend add two inch measurement waist 36 inch would order size 38 ut kilt would exactly right size however often wear heavy weight shirt add 4 inch measurement instead 2 inch still tiny bit loose easily take slack waist belt two waist strap buckle build kilt gain bit weight add inch waist holiday feasting still go kilt fit properly get small stretch fit 6feet tall kilt 22inches long top hem bottom hem wear properly bottom hem partially cover knee kilt sell amazon tend run 24inches long longer short 22inch length final factor decision buy ut kiltsthe belt loop exceptional ut kilt folk also carry ab excellent 2 14inch belt perfect job however celtic belt buckle list amazon configure 1 12inch belt numerous review discuss mismatch size opt continue use 2inch heavy leather work belt worn year old kilt work fine find right buckle would recommend ut kilt anyone tried wear kilt give two enthusiastic thumb veteran kilt wearer consider purchase

"i'm not a master at video games, so i was worried about how impossible this game might be.  however, i was hooked on all the cool, special jedi powers and more importantly, the storyline, within minutes into the tutorial.  this game has it all for a star wars fan. great plot, interesting characters, fun places to explore, and insanely cool powers.

levels are short and intense, so you can spend ten minutes playing one level then go about your day, or play the entire game straight through.  i loved being able to customize outfits and lightsabers and have those changes appear in the in-game video.  once the game is completed, you have the options to replay with all your force power points in-tact, so you can become more powerful each time you play the game (which is fun and not repetitive to do).  the force powers are very fun to weild (my favorite in the force lightening).

i found myself really invested in the outcome of this game.  not only is it great game-play, but it really is a fascinating storyline.  the plot drives the game because the main character goes from the dark side to his own side to being a jedi knight, leaving the player wondering what really goes on inside this character's head, something i've never even considered while playing a video game.

it may not be the most challenging game ever (which i appreciated), but it is the best adventure game i've ever played on the wii console.  highly recommended!!",0,game,master video game worry impossible game might however hook cool special jedi power importantly storyline within minute tutorial game star war fan great plot interest character fun place explore insanely cool power level short intense spend ten minute play one level go day play entire game straight love able customize outfit lightsabers change appear ingame video game complete option replay force power point intact become powerful time play game fun repetitive force power fun weild favorite force lighten find really invested outcome game great gameplay really fascinating storyline plot drive game main character go dark side side jedi knight leave player wonder really go inside character head something never even consider play video game may challenge game ever appreciate best adventure game ever play wii console highly recommend

"it's okay. there are some minor annoyances.
like how you can't set up a universal game mode for it, each configuration is game specific and you can only access each specific configuration by loading the game up and opening the steam community overlay and selecting the configuration there.
you can't change the configuration for how it functions when not playing a game outside of big screen mode (i think valve is really pushing the steam link no thanks guys). when you set up a specific configuration for either the desktop or big screen modes they are only active while steam is open.
most of the features like the haptic feedback (hd rumble) only work in a handful of games.
it's hard to find the 0 position when you change the right pad to act like a thumbstick which means you're constantly having to readjust and it can be disorienting when the camera reacts to the slightest touch.
the controller just feels kind of awkward in the hand.
the trigger and shoulder buttons feel sort of halfway between the xbone controller and the ps 4 controller in that they feel similar when you press them to the xbone and the actual size and position and the texture is more like the dual shock controller. i don't particularly like either of those controllers. xbox 360 controller has the best feel but that's just my opinion.
overall it's not terrible. maybe it's just a learning curve and i haven't spent enough time with it to appreciate it yet, but i still prefer my xbox 360 controller though.",1,game,okay minor annoyance like set universal game mode configuration game specific access specific configuration loading game open steam community overlay select configuration change configuration function play game outside big screen mode think valve really push steam link thanks guy set specific configuration either desktop big screen mode active steam open feature like haptic feedback hd rumble work handful game hard find 0 position change right pad act like thumbstick mean constantly readjust disorient camera react slight touch controller feel kind awkward hand trigger shoulder button feel sort halfway xbone controller p 4 controller feel similar press xbone actual size position texture like dual shock controller particularly like either controller xbox 360 controller best feel opinion overall terrible maybe learn curve spend enough time appreciate yet still prefer xbox 360 controller though

"the berlitz spanish premier was very easy to install and was ready to use in about 5 minutes.  i was able to jump right in and start the first lesson.  the directions for each activity were a little hard for me to understand. i didn't like the fact that i had to go online to get further directions.  i was able to figure the activities out myself by just trying it but would have preferred better directions with each activity in the software. i really liked how many activities there were for learning the vocabulary and reading skills.  the flashcards were a perfect way to learn the vocabulary.  the program gives many different ways to learn the vocabulary on the flashcards. you can start with just english to spanish but you can progress to producing the words yourself either from english or spanish.  i think that is a great way to learn the vocabulary and really memorize it. throughout the learning process, berlitz spanish premier gives the pronunciation multiple times which helped to be able to pronounce each word myself.  i liked how there were practice conversations to help learn how to have a real conversation.  i think the lessons cover the basics of learning a language but was hoping for even more.  overall, i think the berlitz spanish premier is a great resource to learn the basics of a foreign language.

(wow - imagine that happening in a small startup construction company.)  right now this client has only 1 employee but will have 2 or 3 max when he finds the right crew.  guess what - i now have to tell the client he will need to put out another 150.00+ because his employees did not work out. intuit -- here is a little unwanted advise.  just up your price and stop with the games.  people are talking...  isn't a reputation worth anything anymore?,1,software,consultant 20 year work first version quickbooks release quickbooks always account system choice client last installed version 2007 job offer could refuse new client take felt good recommending quickbooks 2012 easy install payroll software say buyer beware floor quickbooks limit 13 employee unless pay additional money unlimited never limit number employee quickbooks prior consulting year right new client employee already 2 new hire last less week wow imagine happen small startup construction company right client 1 employee 2 3 max find right crew guess tell client need put another 15000+ employee work intuit little unwanted advise price stop game people talk reputation worth anything anymore

"after discussing some of the computer issues i was having on my home pc at work, a co-worker recommended spysweeper. she had told me she had had success with the software and it sounded great. i then went to a local computer store and asked for further opinions. again i was directed to spysweeper. so i thought, what the heck, three people can't be wrong. sigh.

the software was ridiculously easy to install and i ran into zero problems doing my first ""sweep"". it seemed to be working wonderfully and i noticed numerous pesky adware names being removed. i rebooted my computer, jumped online, and, woo-hoo!, there were no pop-ups and the internet didn't crash once. the next day was a different story entirely.

the next morning brought fewer pop-ups, but pop-ups nonetheless. and then the internet started to crash again. aside from those issues--which i should no longer have been having--spysweeper became annoying in and of itself. it swept at the drop of the hat. even though i altered the schedule and options. and there were some spyware and adware that it just wouldn't get rid of.

overall, i was initially pleased with the software, but that has certainly waned. now i have to go back out and find something else to help with this problem. if i could return spysweeper i think i would be tempted to do so.",1,software,discuss computer issue home pc work coworker recommend spysweeper told success software sound great go local computer store ask opinion direct spysweeper thought heck three people wrong sigh software ridiculously easy install run zero problem first sweep seem work wonderfully notice numerous pesky adware name remove reboot computer jump online woohoo popups internet crash next day different story entirely next morning bring few popups popups nonetheless internet start crash aside issueswhich longer havingspysweeper become annoy swept drop hat even though altered schedule option spyware adware would get rid overall initially pleased software certainly wan go back find something els help problem could return spysweeper think would tempt

"first of all, a little background so you know where this review is coming from: i currently live in japan and have been studying the language off and on for the past 8 years.  that said, i still have a lot to learn and while i can engage in basic everyday conversation, i am far from being fluent.  i have many years experience both teaching and learning foreign languages in academic and professional environments.

this piece of software seems to be quite popular with folks who have never tried to study japanese before, but if you have any sort of training in the language it is a waste of time.  if you can read and understand the following sentence, i'd definitely recommend that you save your time and money and don't bother with this piece of software:

watashi wa nihongo wo benkyou shimasu.

i can overlook the minor flaws in kana stroke order, but what is ridiculous is the fact that even if you ace the beginning level placement test with a 50/50 (100%) score, you only get placed up to lesson 11 -- learning overly simplistic vocabulary words like man, woman, and cat.  the developers should have made the level placement test more diagnostic so that it could actually accurately assess ones true level.  as it is, people with any sort of prior training in japanese will have spend several days muddling through dozens of boring and useless lessons/minigames in order to unlock the higher levels which may be of actual use.

the game may give absolute beginners a very rudimentary introduction to japanese, but even the teaching style leaves a lot to be desired and i believe beginning japanese learners would actually get more out of visiting places like japanesepod101 (a free japanese language learning podcast site) or buying a basic japanese textbook like the genki or japanese for busy people series and making flashcards to memorize their kana.

japanese language training on the ds is a nice idea and i'd really love to see more language training software for the ds be made available in the future.  however, ""my japanese coach"" is marred by a frustrating leveling system and a haphazard approach to learning the language.",2,game,first little background know review come currently live japan study language past 8 year say still lot learn engage basic everyday conversation far fluent many year experience teach learn foreign language academic professional environment piece software seem quite popular folk never try study japanese sort training language waste time read understand follow sentence would definitely recommend save time money bother piece software watashi wa nihongo wo benkyou shimasu overlook minor flaw kana stroke order ridiculous fact even ace begin level placement test 5050 100drunk_or_confused score get place lesson 11 learn overly simplistic vocabulary word like man woman cat developer make level placement test diagnostic could actually accurately assess one true level people sort prior train japanese spend several day muddle dozen bore useless lessonsminigames order unlock high level may actual use game may give absolute beginner rudimentary introduction japanese even teach style leave lot desired believe begin japanese learner would actually get visiting place like japanesepod101 free japanese language learn podcast site buying basic japanese textbook like genki japanese busy people series make flashcard memorize kana japanese language training ds nice idea would really love see language train software d make available future however japanese coach mar frustrate level system haphazard approach learning language

"wasn't very good. i had hoped that since 13 and 13-2 were kind of vague plotwise that 3 would help it all come together in a glorious ending. what i got was nothing short of massive disapointment. no real closure. just ""i control my fate!"" nonsense with a antagonist unseen the entire game. though that might have been typical in final fantasy, i'm ashamed to say the 13 series was a letdown. since 11 and 14 were mediocre plot-wise mmo's, i have little faith in square any longer. enix was the nail in the coffin of a once great company. 12 was unfinished admittedly by the director, though an epic full game. 13 was cut into 3, as 1 did not stand alone well, 2 was a massive waste of time. all together the series comes together in a world that you don't really want to save. you spend the entire game doing sidequests for people you don't care about who will ""die"" anyway per the opening plot device. you cannot save the world. there's no point to this game. the fighting was strange. you were supposedly a god-like figure in game yet you were extremely weak early on. game's can't work like this. you need to build up to being godly. the main character needs to start downtrodden. it makes the plot worth venturing through so that he/she can transcend adversity. there's no leveling system, so you can't practically tell your strength in any real form. hitting 100 vs hitting 1000 was a big deal in previous rpg's, and i'd argue people loved that difference. you felt like you made progress. there's none of that in this game. you get stronger the more stupid quests you finish and it's not even a tangible difference outside of hp. there's no point in grinding, except to get a certain spell you're looking for. i hated playing as lightning. she was cold and emotionless ""by design!"" so that makes it bearable to play with her? terrible decision. lightning needed the others to work as a moody indifferent character. i played through 13 because i liked sazh and vanille. i even enjoyed x2 because serah and noel were a team that looked good together. noel was a little moody, but it was ok because serah was not. previous ff games had good character balance. compared to x-2, a game with payne as the solo character wouldn't have worked without the bubbly rikku and niave yuna.",2,game,good hop since 13 132 kind vague plotwise 3 would help come together glorious end get nothing short massive disapointment real closure control fate nonsense antagonist unseen entire game though might typical final fantasy ashamed say 13 series letdown since 11 14 mediocre plotwise mmo little faith square longer enix nail coffin great company 12 unfinished admittedly director though epic full game 13 cut 3 1 stand alone well 2 massive waste time together series come together world really want save spend entire game sidequests people care die anyway per open plot device save world point game fight strange supposedly godlike figure game yet extremely weak early game work like need build godly main character need start downtrodden make plot worth venture heshe transcend adversity leveling system practically tell strength real form hit 100 v hit 1000 big deal previous rpg would argue people love difference felt like make progress none game get strong stupid quest finish even tangible difference outside hp point grind except get certain spell look hat play lightning cold emotionless design make bearable play terrible decision lightning need other work moody indifferent character play 13 liked sazh vanille even enjoy x2 serah noel team look good together noel little moody ok serah previous ff game good character balance compare x2 game payne solo character would work without bubbly rikku niave yuna

"hgtv's home & landscape platinum suite is packed with features, but it is not a program for the faint of heart! if you are looking to design your dream home, or to remodel the one you are living in, this program will suit your needs. i don't have any design background, but i do consider myself quite adept at using the computer. i have to admit that this program took quite some time to learn to use, and i don't even feel as if i've scratched the surface of its capabilities.

my husband was happy to see that you can import and export to an autocad file. i was happy about the design choices (products and styles), although i had a hard time finding the ""library of 10,000+ home plans.""  reading further, i realized that you can only view them if you are buying plans for construction. you can totally create your dream living space from start to finish, and have a viable plan to stay in charge of your remodel.

some of my favorite features of this program are the landscaping options, the option to upload a photo of your existing home and make changes to it, and the brand name paint colors. since my husband is a land surveyor, i also appreciate the option to import and export (*.dxf), (*.3ds), and vrml (*.wrl) files, because he knows what they are even if i don't!

there are a few things you should know before buying this software. firstly, make sure that you have a ton of space on your computer, as the program requires 1gb of ram. secondly, give yourself some time to learn how to use the program, as sheer size of the user manual at almost 700 pages is overwhelming. thirdly, this software comes with a 90 day money back guarantee, so if you simply can't figure it out, you should be able to return it.

"i participated actively in beta, was part of a guild that sieged and did pvp regularly. i must say that this game has interesting elements to it as far as pvp is concerned, but is no where near ready to launch (as of a week before release). the graphics aren't even as good as ancient everquest, and even with my p4 2ghz machine with a gigabyte of ram and a geforce 4 ti 4400 the game only pulls 30fps with all the details turned down at 800x600. the client is simply terrible.
as far as gameplay goes, you can max your character's level in less than a month, and from there it's all pvp. this, however, is only mildly interesting, even when engaged in large-scale sieges between hundreds of people.
there is very little variety within the classes. each race is obviously designed to be a specific class, to the point where other races taking that class are pretty much gimped and worthless. they also have a heavy-handed skill system, that forces you to take specific weapons, etc... or not be effective in combat.
every character is exactly alike.
oh! and don't even get me started on the class balance issues... it's usually not too bad in other games, but since this is pure pvp, expect a high level mage to run through your camp and gank your entire team pretty often.",2,game,participate actively beta part guild sieged pvp regularly must say game interesting element far pvp concerned near ready launch week release graphic even good ancient everquest even p4 2ghz machine gigabyte ram geforce 4 ti 4400 game pull 30fps detail turn 800x600 client simply terrible far gameplay go max character level less month pvp however mildly interest even engage largescale siege hundred people little variety within class race obviously design specific class point race take class pretty much gimp worthless also heavyhanded skill system force take specific weapon etc effective combat every character exactly alike oh even get started class balance issue usually bad game since pure pvp expect high level mage run camp gank entire team pretty often

typically, there are some improvements in the movements of the players, but nothin fantastic. you do not get fancy footworks or moves that will impress you when u play this game.
honestly speaking, fifa has lost its dominance in the football game market. challenges from others would make ea sport thinking of a better way to improve the game. take for example, winning eleven from konami. i cant hardly put the remote control down due to the excellent graphics and how realistic the movement can be. you get variety of ways players score, kicking the ball, heading the ball, or even how the players fall! it has some kind of like a championship manager in it too.

"it could be a 4 stars product if the synapse 2 software didn't simply lose settings from time to time. and i am using the orochi with the usb cord. i had unplugged the mouse and when i plugged it back in, bam - lost all settings. i mean all. i had customized a few profiles to test, and it lost all profiles. just to prove my point, as i am writing this review i noticed now the mouse has again returned to factory settings. i had customized right side up button for expose and it went back to mouse dpi sensitivity. maybe it lost the settings when it came back from standby. bad bad software.

i could give a 4 star rating for the mouse itself. mouse has a good feel, the usb cord snaps very firmly (almost to the point of being hard to remove) and i am not worried with battery life (which seems to be a frequent complaint) because i had previous wireless mouses in the past and imo they all eat batteries like i eat donuts. with the batteries it's well balanced, without them (using usb cord) it is too light. plastic is great but i feel it could be somehow better, don't ask me why, i just feel it could be better.

yet, given the small offer of bluetooth portable mice, this is indeed top of the class, you won't find better. the market has room for better products though. the logitech anywhere mx for example, is perfect, great feel, great weight, software works very well and it goes as good as it can get. it ate batteries as well. but that usb dongle steals one of the two macbook air usb ports and that made me get a bluetooth mouse.

"i've owned a ps3 since the us launch.  overall the ps3 does a decent job of managing heat dissipation, but adding a little extra insurance, especially during the hotter summer months, certainly doesn't hurt.  i purchased both the nyko intercooler and the pelican ps3 system in order to use and compare both designs.  here is what i found:

appearance:

the ps3 has a very distinctive design, with people either loving it or hating it.  i, for one, think it's a great looking system, and i want to keep it that way.  unless it was absolutely necessary i didn't want to add on a fan that looked tacked on and detracted from the console's asthetic appeal.

out of the two fan systems, nyko handled the system integration with the ps3 the worst.  the nyko intercooler attaches a big block onto the rear, with four fans and an interface to share juice from the ps3's power cable.  it also adds an additional fan bank on the right side/top of the console. the combination of fan banks on the side and back really detracted from the console's appearance.  the ps3 looks ungainly and out of proportion with the fan system strapped on.

the pelican system on the other hand includes a single bank of fans located on the right side or top for those daring enough to stand it on end.  the fit, finish, and contour of the fan bank blends seamlessly with the console's shape and finish. even the fan vent holes match the shape and design of the existing vent holes on the console, which is not the case with nyko's design.  the pelican design also includes either the chrome or black trim to match the original console's trim finish.  when the fan is attached it looks like it came straight from the factory that way.

design:

nyko's system draws it's power from the ps3's cable, so it's an inline design, which is better than if it were to draw power from the ps3's usb ports. the nyko system must be turned on/off manually each time, and unfortunately they tied that to the ps3 power button.  now, when you place the ps3 in standby mode, the fan will remain on until you physically turn off the ps3's power switch. for the inconvenience nyko moved the power switch from the rear to the front.  manually turning the system off each time is an inconvenience, and the relocation of the switch to the front further clutters up the ps3's sleek appearance.  also, to add to the ugly factor, nyko felt compelled to add an unsightly ""intercooler"" label on the top of the fan.  really??? was that level of tackiness really necessary?

the pelican system comes with it's own power supply, so it doesn't interfere with the ps3's at all.  the switch is located out of sight on the back, and it glows for convenience.  the nicest part of the pelican design is that it has a built in thermostat, so it automatically turns on or off depending on the internal temperature of the ps3.  when you turn the system on the fan won't engage until the system heats up, and when you shut it off it will continue running until the system has cooled down sufficiently.  very nice.

performance:

my comparisons for performance are completely subjective.  i didn't measure with anything but my sense of touch and hearing.  both systems did a sufficient job cooling the ps3.  for heat dissipation i really didn't notice a difference between the two.  audibly, the nyko system was noticeably louder than the pelican system.  the ps3's built in system is very quiet, so any additional noise is noticeable.  both systems add fan noise, but the nyko system is louder.  as a positive though, the nyko system's variable fan control allows you to turn it down, which is helpful during blu-ray or super audio cd playback.  i use the pelican system and just turn it off if needed for blu-ray or sacd playback.  it's quiet enough that i mostly leave it running though.

overall:

i have to recommend the pelican system over the nyko intercooler, even given the additional $15 cost.  the pelican system just has a better design to compliment the ps3's great lines, plus it is better built and quieter too.  having an external fan will help prolong any console's life, but it doesn't have to look bad while doing it.

i did a lot of searching for a perfect price and 2 for $12.xx seemed great - i figured i could use one for travel. but was disappointed when one of them was received damaged and clearly quick cuts to the threads. i know that a lot of people have complained about these falling apart quickly - so i opted to return them as i don't want them to deteriorate faster then they already might.

the really big difference with the game is the pvp.  it is so easy to get involved in a pvp battle without having to have some huge leveled up character.  the public quests are also great.  if you come across a quest that is going on you can just jump in and help and then be eligible for any rewards from that quest.

"small caveat -- these are not the best sounding headphones for audiophiles, but they do sound fantastic for the price!  this is the best sounding headset you can get for under $30 (they are about $17 at the time of this review, which is insanely cheap).  i tested several different headsets and these sounded the best by far.  if you're looking for a good quality inexpensive headset for gaming, start with this one.  if you hate it, exchange it for something else.

more in depth; the build quality is fine.  they don't feel super cheap, but obviously they don't feel like $100 studio monitors either.  the cord quality is really nice though, it's braided nylon or something on the outside so there are no worries about durability.  it's also plenty long enough (about 6 feet i think) so even if your headphone/mic jacks are in the very back of your pc case it will still probably reach.  they're relatively comfortable, the only thing to note is that they're not quite large enough to go completely around your ears, the soft pleather cushions will be sitting directly on your earlobes which might be a problem for some people with very sensitive lobes or people who want to game with these on for extended gaming sessions of more than a few hours long.  the mic sounds pretty clear and doesn't sound like you're talking through a tin can which is what most mics seem to sound like nowadays.  as far as the audio quality of the headphones there is a ton of bass and low end, and the entire frequency spectrum from 20hz to 20khz sounds pretty clear and you can hear detail.  but, the higher frequencies roll off and there's a distinct lack of brightness in the high end of the spectrum.  in my opinion, this is not great, but certainly livable for $17.  luckily for me i have my headset hooked up to an eq where i can boost the high end to make up the difference, which makes the headphones sound incredible overall, but i realize not everyone has that option so it's something to be aware of.

"i'm writing this note since i just downloaded the product and couldn't install it either on my windows 7 system, like others have mentioned.  here's how i got it to work.  first, it should be pointed out that he problem isn't from crazy machine 2 itself, but rather with the anti-piracy program that comes with the download.  the first time you run the cm2, it wants to automatically activate the program by running ""tagesclient.exe"" which is located under the same folder as ""cm2.exe"" (where you installed the game).

so the first thing to do is ""simply"" download the latest version of ""tagesclient.exe"", which works with win 7.  i found it here for both the 32 bit/64 bit platforms.

[...].

download and install the appropriate file.

then, in my case anyway, i needed to start the crazy machine program (only the first time) with administrator priviledges.  one way do this is to press the ""shift key"" while ""right-clicking"" on the desktop icon the game installation created. select ""run as administrator"" from there.  from that point on, the activation process will begin and just follow the instructions.  next time you start the game (in regular mode, i.e. non-admin), things should be good.

of course, you must meet the minimum requirements which is to have a physx graphics card installed on your machine.  if this doesn't sound familiar to you.. chances are... you don't have it.

"nothing is wrong with the old software, but the company has decided to change their format.  instead of offering a great product that i can buy once and upgrade when i want, they have decided to compete with other products and offer a cloud based system that can only be used via subscription.  to make this worse....they've brought the new product out before it is really ready.

i have no interest in a cloud based system and what once cost me $40-60 every few years...if i chose to even upgrade...now will cost me $60 a year.

i understand what i need and will go back to using excel.  it isn't as good or attractive, but it's stable, predictable, and once created won't go away later.

i really feel like the ynab leaders let me down.  they had a great product that came about for really great reasons and were backed by a great community.  now they've moved on from the people that loved them.

things change....i understand.... but my opinion can change too and it has.

update:  (go ahead and read the rest, but i wanted to put my update at the top so you'd see it)  i have been using this product for over a year now and i couldn't have made a better purchase.  this software is absolutely fantastic for home budgeting and simply makes sense once you figure it all out.  i would still prefer better reports, but they work for what i need.  they've upgraded the version now, so i can't tell you about it....but unless they changed the foundation, it will still be a great tool for your home financials.

oh...when they update the version, you do not get upgrades unless you pay for it.  i didn't upgrade since i just bought the software last year.  this is my only real complaint, but business is business so i understand.  i would give this product 6 stars if available.

previous review:

i have been budgeting for the last 5 years.  previously, i used ms money for my accounts & a home made excel spreadsheet for the budget.  this worked fine and i'd tweaked the spreadsheet to suit my needs.  i had a hard drive failure recently and lost all my data.  instead of redoing the sheet, i thought i'd investigate some online software and found ynab.  i was pleasantly surprised.  i am able to log all my accounts (cash, checking, liabilities, investments, etc), make them communicate with each other and make them communicate perfectly with the integrated budget.  the budget now is almost a living thing as i can download transactions every couple of days and begin preparing for next months budget as i'm paid and pay off this months bills.

it does take some getting used to, but i don't see much way around this.  money is difficult to track and with various avenues for it to come, go, or just sit... its simply going to a complicated piece of software that will get it right.  even with a fairly good handle on budgeting and my own finances, i still spent the better part of 7-8 hours the first day i got it installed figuring it out.  that was worth it though because now i feel confident in what this software can do and how i'll be able to use it.  if a new user does feel overwhelmed, the creators offer many types of online help & webinars to guide you through the process.  just take the time to learn it and it will be worth it in the end.

my only ""complaint"" is that the reporting capabilities could be better.  i believe the makers admit this and are working on adding to this feature.  i'd really like to see a way to do reports on ""payees"" instead of ""fields"" only, but i can do with what the software offers since it brings so much to the table.  i simply set up more ""fields"" to track the money in that fashion instead of by ""payee"".

if you are new to home budgeting or a veteran looking for something to make your life easier.... this software is fantastic.",2,software,nothing wrong old software company decide change format instead offer great product buy upgrade want decide compete product offer cloud base system use via subscription make worsethey bring new product really ready interest cloud base system cost $ 4060 every yearsif choose even upgradenow cost $ 60 year understand need go back use excel good attractive stable predictable create go away later really feel like ynab leader let great product come really great reason back great community move people loved thing changei understand opinion change update go ahead read rest want put update top would see use product year could make good purchase software absolutely fantastic home budgeting simply make sense figure would still prefer good report work need upgraded version tell itbut unless change foundation still great tool home financials ohwhen update version get upgrades unless pay upgrade since buy software last year real complaint business business understand would give product 6 star available previous review budget last 5 year previously use ms money account & home make excel spreadsheet budget work fine would tweak spreadsheet suit need hard drive failure recently lose data instead redo sheet think would investigate online software find ynab pleasantly surprise able log account cash check liability investment etc make communicate make communicate perfectly integrated budget budget almost living thing download transaction every couple day begin prepare next month budget pay pay month bill take get use see much way around money difficult track various avenue come go sit simply go complicate piece software get right even fairly good handle budgeting finance still spend good part 78 hour first day get installed figuring worth though feel confident software able use new user feel overwhelm creator offer many type online help & webinars guide process take time learn worth end complaint reporting capability could better believe maker admit work add feature would really like see way report payee instead field software offer since brings much table simply set field track money fashion instead payee new home budgeting veteran look something make life easy software fantastic
"ok, i received my leopard on 8/16.  the installation went well.  pretty much everything worked faster & looked nicer (you'll see a cosmic new intro after the installation is complete).  now i'm a long time apple user & have been more than happy with all things apple.  because of this i didn't read any product reviews before ordering it.  i really should have because when i opened my itunes i didn't see any of my pictures.  i figured all i had to do was some configuring.  & anyway if worse comes to worse my pictures (mostly of my son from a baby until 12) are stored on one of my 2 external hard drives & my ipod.  so i started looking, found the hard drive which had my pics, looked inside & nothing.  so i'm like ""i've gotta be doing something wrong"".  i call up apple.  the customer service people were helpful but they couldn't understand how pictures stored on an external hard drive using iphoto were missing & scheduled me for an appointment at the apple store this coming monday.  so i started doing what i should have done before i ordered the new leopard, i started searching ""missing photos"" and ""leopard"" & found more than a few threads that subject.  this guy here sounds like he's living my life:

"i have completed a full play through of ryse and i can honestly say that i liked the game and i look forward to the multiplayer mode.

***update on multiplayer mode***
honestly, it gets old quickly as it is exactly like the game.  if multiplayer is your selling point, look elsewhere.

***the good***
the graphics - awesome realism and the executions certainly make it that much more good looking.
the story - i love studying about historical (slightly altered timeline in the case of ryse) cultures and this was certainly a fun trip through rome
the gameplay - this felt a lot like batman (arkham series) and it certainly can be fun if you appreciate those sort of mechanics

***the bad***
short campaign - i played through on the most difficult mode and made it through in about 6 hours with me purposefully looking around for collectibles, that fine considering the repetitive gameplay.
repetitive gameplay - crytek tried to mix it up with some different weapons but this game should have made use of more weapons that had different executions rather than the sword and shield most of the time.
camera - there were few times when the camera got lost and i could not see my character in the fight. a much smaller issue considering it only happened three or four times throughout the campaign.

***overall***
buy this game if you like the mechanics of chopping through endless hordes of bad guys with little to no difficulty (even on the hardest mode) much like batman (arkham series) on easy mode. i enjoyed this game and i do not regret my purchase and i hope to see you on the xbox live multiplayer soon!",0,game,complete full play ryse honestly say liked game look forward multiplayer mode * * * update multiplayer mode * * * honestly get old quickly exactly like game multiplayer sell point look elsewhere * * * good * * * graphic awesome realism execution certainly make much good look story love study historical slightly alter timeline case ryse culture certainly fun trip rome gameplay felt lot like batman arkham series certainly fun appreciate sort mechanic * * * bad * * * short campaign play difficult mode make 6 hour purposefully look around collectible fine consider repetitive gameplay repetitive gameplay crytek try mix different weapon game make use weapon different execution rather sword shield time camera time camera get lose could see character fight much small issue consider happen three four time throughout campaign * * * overall * * * buy game like mechanic chop endless horde bad guy little difficulty even hard mode much like batman arkham series easy mode enjoy game regret purchase hope see xbox live multiplayer soon
"paint shop pro has been a favorite graphics software for many years and has a large number of faithful users. it is used by photographers and hobbyists to arrange, organize, adjust and enhance photos. on the other hand, it is used by many artists to create digital art, marketing and web graphics and more. paint shop pro is on its eleventh upgrade and is now owned by the corel corporation. with this latest upgrade, named paint shop pro photo xi, the software has some new and improved features that will help you increase your creativity and productivity.

the new photo organizer is the newest generation of the old browser. as in previous versions, you can use the new photo organizer to view thumbnails of your stored images and video clips or search based on filename, date, file type and size, folder location, tags and ratings. another new feature is the quick review slide-show that lets you view images or video clips in full screen mode, make basic adjustments or add text.

once you get organized, it's time to play with some of the other new features. the one i enjoyed the most is the time machine which you will find under the effects menu. this new feature quickly converts your photos into representations of what that photo would look like if it was taken with the photographic equipment available in the past. the time machine spans several decades starting with the daguerreotype used from 1839 - 1855, moving along the timeline to albumen (1855 - 1890), cyanotype, platinum (1873 - 1920), early color, box cameras and finally cross process (1960+).

also new is the depth of field photo effect found in the adjust menu. this effect simulates the depth of field created with expensive camera filters. after you select the area of the photo that you wish to be your point of interest, the program blurs the areas surrounding the selected area.

the crop tool has been improved giving you more control via a new floating toolbar. you can choose one of the preset crop sizes, draw the crop rectangle free form and rotate the crop rectangle. other new features includes the film and filters effects which contains many customizable photo effects including vivid skin tones and vibrant foliage which, as the names suggest, enhance certain colors in your photos. the e-mail command has been improved so that it automatically resizes your images before adding them to your email, as an attachment or embedded in the email message itself.

paint shop pro photo comes packaged with a few extras including trail versions of two of corel's software, corel painter essentials and snapfire plus se. snapfire is especially nice for those who enjoy computer crafts. it contains several project templates for album pages, greeting cards, calendars and collages.",0,software,paint shop pro favorite graphic software many year large number faithful user use photographer hobbyist arrange organize adjust enhance photo hand use many artist create digital art marketing web graphic paint shop pro eleventh upgrade own corel corporation late upgrade name paint shop pro photo xi software new improve feature help increase creativity productivity new photo organizer new generation old browser previous version use new photo organizer view thumbnail store image video clip search base filename date file type size folder location tag rating another new feature quick review slideshow let view image video clip full screen mode make basic adjustment add text get organize time play new feature one enjoyed time machine find effect menu new feature quickly convert photo representation photo would look like take photographic equipment available past time machine span several decade start daguerreotype use 1839 1855 move along timeline albumen 1855 1890 cyanotype platinum 1873 1920 early color box camera finally cross process 1960+ also new depth field photo effect find adjust menu effect simulate depth field create expensive camera filter select area photo wish point interest program blur area surround select area crop tool improve give control via new float toolbar choose one preset crop size draw crop rectangle free form rotate crop rectangle new feature include film filter effect contain many customizable photo effect include vivid skin tone vibrant foliage name suggest enhance certain color photos email command improve automatically resizes image add email attachment embed email message paint shop pro photo come package extra include trail version two corel software corel painter essential snapfire plus se snapfire especially nice enjoy computer craft contain several project templates album page greet card calendar collage

"the functionality is good enough, and i will probably use turbotax again next year, but all the hidden charges they sneak in are very frustrating. just tell me up front how much my return is going to be.

first you pay for the software.
then you pay $20 to file state.
then there's a filing fee $50 for everything, even though they state repeatedly federal is free.
then there's another $30 fee just electronically process your refund.

when all is said and done it costs around $100 or more (depending on the software package you buy) to file. for that price you could just pay a tax preparer to do the entire thing for you. the only convenience is that you don't have to sit and dig everything up for a person to prep the return. basically you're paying $100+ to do all the work yourself at your own convenience. i may end up experimenting with some of the other services next year. mostly the expense doesn't bother me. i itemize but it's not a complicated return. i have some charatiable donations, and i own a home. so i have to itemize to get the little bit back that those allow me, but in general turbotax isn't doing anything special to save me money.

if you're not itemizing and filing single, you might consider using another software, or using one of the web based services that doesn't lie about fees and trick you into spending more. it's really garbage that they charge you so much to electronically deposit your return. unless you want to wait a month or more for the irs to cut a check, why wouldn't you do electronic deposit? tt knows this and they use it as an opportunity to squeeze you for a few extra bucks, because why not? you're getting a refund. it's shady and infuriating.

writing this review the more i think about it the more annoyed i am, and i'm less likely to use tt again.",1,software,functionality good enough probably use turbotax next year hidden charge sneak frustrate tell front much return go first pay software pay $ 20 file state filing fee $ 50 everything even though state repeatedly federal free another $ 30 fee electronically process refund say do cost around $ 100 depend software package buy file price could pay tax preparer entire thing convenience sit dig everything person prep return basically pay $ 100+ work convenience may end experiment service next year mostly expense bother itemize complicate return charatiable donation home itemize get little bit back allow general turbotax anything special save money itemize file single might consider use another software use one web base service lie fee trick spend really garbage charge much electronically deposit return unless want wait month irs cut check would electronic deposit tt know use opportunity squeeze extra buck get refund shady infuriate write review think annoy less likely use tt

"i am using this software with the full version of outlook and using the default level of protection.  it filters my spam emails down from about 100/day to about 10/day, however even after spending the $ for the full version of outlook there are significant bugs and limitations to this solution.
the biggest issue is the lack of support and definition updates.  spam is constantly evolving to be more difficult to detect, and yet the last major release of this product is now a half year old, and the product update process does not work well at all.  my correspondence with the company has been unanswered or i have been directed to install even older versions to work around bugs.  clicking to receive the latest definition updates has no discernable effect upon the filter effectiveness or lack thereof.
it does not fully support organization rules that sort email into different mailboxes.  if you are using multiple mailboxes they do not automatically get filtered and you need to manually click clean mailbox | unread mail every day on one or more mailboxes.
also, i found the automatic spam reporting capabilities (notifying policing agencies) to be unusable.  at this point i manually forward the few most offensive items to spamcop and delete the rest.
on the good side there have been almost no cases where it mistakenly quarantined mail that i desired to receive.

"i received the garmin etrex legend for use in hiking around some of the national parks here (notably shenandoah).  i purchased the topo mapsource so i would be relieved of having to manually translate waypoints and routes from my paper maps to the legend.
i found the software easy to use, and surprisingly detailed.  i hadn't expected it to have more than a few of the trails in shenandoah, but from what i can tell it has 99% of them.  this relieved me of having to keep a paper map in my thigh pocket, as i just had the legend attached to my pack for occasional reference to the route i was taking.
while i have only looked at a small portion of the maps in this product, i did note several landmarks were in the wrong place....most notably bear church rock in the central district of shenandoah.  it is at least 0.10 mile further to the ne than it is on the map...not a big deal unless you are trying to find it for the first time.  my accuracy was right on as well, as i was standing on top of a mountain with a total of 9 satellite locks, three of them waas enabled, and i was good to about 15 feet.  i tend to think the problem might have been mainly with the map.
i also found that contour lines were a little off, usually about 100 feet or so.  not a big deal until you're at the end of a weekend and have been hiking uphill all day!
on the software i would love a feature that would let me do an elevation profile of a given route.  as i misread some contour lines it led to a rather nasty surprise when i hit a particular leg and had to go up a rather steep incline.
finally, maps of park areas are uploaded with a gray shading that makes it somewhat difficult to easily spot trails and things on the display of the legend.  when i'm in nav mode i can easily see my route, but other trails tend to blend into the background.
but these are fairly minor nits.  i like being able to upload full topo maps to the legend instead of simple pois and routes.  and having a good level of detail on those maps made changing my route once on the trail quite easy to do.  i just wish there was more attention paid to the planning side of the software.",0,software,receive garmin etrex legend use hike around national park notably shenandoah purchase topo mapsource would relieve manually translate waypoints rout paper map legend find software easy use surprisingly detail expect trail shenandoah tell 99 % relieved keep paper map thigh pocket legend attach pack occasional reference route take look small portion map product note several landmark wrong placemost notably bear church rock central district shenandoah least 010 mile ne mapnot big deal unless try find first time accuracy right well stand top mountain total 9 satellite lock three waas enable good 15 foot tend think problem might mainly map also find contour line little usually 100 foot big deal end weekend hike uphill day software would love feature would let elevation profile give route misread contour line lead rather nasty surprise hit particular leg go rather steep incline finally map park area upload gray shading make somewhat difficult easily spot trails thing display legend nav mode easily see route trail tend blend background fairly minor nit like able upload full topo map legend instead simple poi route good level detail map make change route trail quite easy wish attention pay planning side software

"i bought this map set for a trip to italy recently and the navigation proved accurate and useful for most of my driving in italy.  the garmin was accurate for getting me out of rome from the hertz termini office, and onto the road towards sorrento.  we navigated successfully through the naples area to our hotel in sorrento, and the garmin was accurate for a drive from our sorrento hotel to pompeii and back.  i got into one problem in sorrento when i missed a turn and the garmin sent me to a junction of very narrow streets  - i was able to turn around and get back on track.  the garmin was also accurate on our drive from sorrento to orvieto and then on to florence.  we navigated successfully through florence until we got to the old city and then you have to turn it off.  the garmin will not work in the old city of florence - i had been warned and this is true.  i got lost and finally hired a cab to lead me to my hotel.  but i really do not fault the garmin as it is generally not advised to drive in florence.  no problem navigating out of florence back to rome and the fumicino airport.  i think you want to stay on major routes and larger roads and be careful if driving in small towns or city centers - use a map and watch the signs instead of using the garmin in situations where city centers are closed to traffic or where you may end up in very narrow streets.  all in all, the garmin was very helpful for driving in italy and i recommend the map set.",0,software,buy map set trip italy recently navigation prove accurate useful drive italy garmin accurate get rome hertz terminus office onto road towards sorrento navigate successfully naples area hotel sorrento garmin accurate drive sorrento hotel pompeii back get one problem sorrento miss turn garmin send junction narrow street able turn around get back track garmin also accurate drive sorrento orvieto florence navigate successfully florence get old city turn garmin work old city florence warn true get lose finally hire cab lead hotel really fault garmin generally advise drive florence problem navigate florence back rome fumicino airport think want stay major route large road careful drive small town city center use map watch sign instead use garmin situation city center close traffic may end narrow street garmin helpful drive italy recommend map set

"kris, et all.  like many reviewers in the past, i have to agree there are no significant features to warrant upgrading.  if there's a new feature (not many for most users) that you're dieing for, certainly upgrade.  i upgraded (regrettably) since there was a new feature to delete all bills area out.  i had two phantom bills which kept showing up and every month an additional set would show up as past due.  the number of past dues would have kept increasing every month. the short version is this feature (delete all bills area) did not work for me.  after discussing the issue with ms, the solution was to export every account (investments have two accounts) to a qif file and the one at a time re-import each qif file in.  this was an absolute brutal recovery and i've spent well over 35 - 40 hours getting it cleaned up.  after each import you have to delete the duplicate/double posts in both accounts.  as one web site once noted, this is not for the faint-of-heart.  one of the features toted in this version is the budget improvement.  so in fairness, i decided to test this out.  i really didn't see any improvements during the interview portion, but afterwards the budget screen just shows a tan box where the cash flow used to be.  basically, it didn't work (keep in mind i basically started from scratch with the imports).  i'm not impressed.  the bottom line:  don't upgrade just because there is a new version.  if there's something you have to have, then sure upgrade if people say it (the to-die-for feature) works.  i rate this a 2 for current ms money users and a 3 for users who have no personal finance management (pfm) software.  if you are torn between quicken and ms money as a new user, go with quicken because most professional/reviewers like q the best.

today the software is far better, but the bar is that much higher. any situation where the software poses a question that a lay person cannot answer, or where a filer of the covered returns is in a situation that the software cannot handle is unacceptable. for me, this happens a couple times a year. right now, the state return has taken me down the path of filing an amended return, then asked me what year the return is for, but only offer 2015 for the choice (not the year i want). oh well... the next problem is that it won't let me delete the form it's created - the form just keeps popping back up. who wrote this this thing? other less severe problems, but much more common, are asking for information that it already has (or not being clear that it already has the info), from last year, from the fed return, or from revisiting a section already visited.

"this was the first time in about 5 years that i used turbo tax.  i was impressed with several aspects of the product:

- very easy to use interface and interview style questions

- incorporates its deductatble to make donations easy to track

- allows you to look at the actual tax forms as you answer the questions

- allows you to import from quicken

i did find this product a little disappointing though.  turbo tax is good if you have a relatively straight forward tax situation (w2s, 1099s, and itemized deductions).  once you start getting into some more unique solutions, turbo tax does a lot of behind the scenes calculations that may or may not be what you are thinking.  as a result, i spent a lot of time reviewing and correcting my 1040.

i also found that the state component of the software is not very strong.  turbo tax provides limited support for questions on state taxes, and i also found that they do not support some of the forms that i am required to submit.  so my state taxes are only partially completed by turbo tax and i have to manually fill out the remaining forms.",1,software,first time 5 year use turbo tax impressed several aspect product easy use interface interview style question incorporate deductatble make donation easy track allow look actual tax form answer question allow import quicken find product little disappointing though turbo tax good relatively straight forward tax situation w2s 1099s itemized deduction start get unique solution turbo tax lot behind scene calculation may may think result spend lot time review correct 1040 also find state component software strong turbo tax provide limited support question state tax also find support form require submit state tax partially complete turbo tax manually fill remain form

"this game is complete nonesense. it is garbage and a waste of my time.  a shame because it could have been great if engineered or developed properly. i am a huge fan of the original side-scrolling games. particularly symphony of the night. compared to the best castlevania has to offer, this lords of shadow game is pathetic.

i found that this game delivers an onslaught of frustration %100 of the time. it isn't fun, it is actually quite stupid and trivial. the only reason why i ever continued to play it past the first chapter is because i spent over $80.00 on the special edition... needless to say i bought it and damn did i loose out, tough i can't get that monie back. it is a fantastic waste. i was also hoping it would get better as i played though it but it didn't it got worse.

play mechanics are 1985. a mere touch or any contact with the enemy means damage to our tiny headed hero. in some instances before the boss or enemy even delivers the hit, you magically get hit adding more insult to injury. to further the frustration, your chain whip is as effective as a licorice. the enemies don't really get hit by it, because they are unstoppable juggernauts, even the little ones. nothing you do with the pathetic whip can stop or deter any of their hits. the damn ghost whip merely robs them of their healthy in a painfully slooow way. while they the enemies in their glory pummel you and remind you just how weak you are. there are also elements of the game that are pointless and not worth talking about cause i really hate this piece of garbage.

i was hoping that camera wasn't going to be a problem , but it is, it oh so painfully is. at times you might die a lot because of the sudden shifts in view.  or you might be running and find yourself running back the wrong way. or if i is a chase you might suddenly get stuck because the camera re aligns your path... and then you might get hurt or die. what does not help is that belmont at times suffers from a retarded slow jump syndrome... yeah, you think you are going to jump normally, but surprise, something went wrong somewhere and he jumps slower and a lot less further than you had planned. although you might have executed the jump like any other jump.

lets wrap this hate fest up. you don't ever feel like your worth something in this game, you get beat time after time. everyone has an advantage over you and you never do catch up. you are weak... uh, the magic does not last nearly as long as it should to be enjoyable. never powerful always weak, covered that... there aren't enough special items. you can't upgrade status or objects, weapons etc. as past games. cause that would mean you become more powerful. oh! and for some reason the developers decided to make all of belmont's moves aimed at getting you closer to your enemies... yeah, your unstoppable enemies. as if you can possibly do a 9 hit combo on enemies that don't even flinch with any whip attack. this just gets you closer to death, ever creeping move after move.

would have been cool it belmont was the man. one slap with a whip that actually made super bad guys cower and display visible pain. like ""pow"" holy , literaly holy crap! that huuurt. but they got it backwards. belmont is a little female dog.",2,game,game complete nonesense garbage waste time shame could great engineer develop properly huge fan original sidescrolling game particularly symphony night compare best castlevania offer lord shadow game pathetic find game delivers onslaught frustration % 100 time fun actually quite stupid trivial reason ever continue play past first chapter spend $ 8000 special edition needle say buy damn loose tough get monie back fantastic waste also hop would get good play though got bad play mechanic 1985 mere touch contact enemy mean damage tiny head hero instance boss enemy even delivers hit magically get hit add insult injury frustration chain whip effective licorice enemy really get hit unstoppable juggernaut even little one nothing pathetic whip stop deter hit damn ghost whip merely rob healthy painfully slooow way enemy glory pummel remind weak also elements game pointless worth talk cause really hate piece garbage hop camera go problem oh painfully time might die lot sudden shift view might run find run back wrong way chase might suddenly get stuck camera align path might get hurt die help belmont time suffers retard slow jump syndrome yeah think go jump normally surprise something go wrong somewhere jump slow lot less plan although might execute jump like jump let wrap hate fest ever feel like worth something game get beat time time everyone advantage never catch weak uh magic last nearly long enjoyable never powerful always weak cover enough special item upgrade status object weapon etc past game cause would mean become powerful oh reason developer decide make belmont move aim get close enemy yeah unstoppable enemy possibly 9 hit combo enemy even flinch whip attack get closer death ever creep move move would cool belmont man one slap whip actually make super bad guy cower display visible pain like pow holy literaly holy crap huuurt get backwards belmont little female dog

"when in story mode the game is seriously lacking directions, and prompts.  for instance, after watching the video describe the big storm in the introduction, the screen jumps to gordon's hill.  there's a sign that says knapford, and another sign with a picture of a shed.  there's no verbal prompts, or instruction, only a butterfly flitting in the air.  after a minute, the narrator says, ""let's check wellsworth station for something to heat up my steam.""  there's no sign for wellsworth station, so you click on the sign that says knapford.  thomas says, ""i'm still feeling a bit cold,"" but the train doesn't move.  then, you click on the other sign.  it says, jeb coal's workshed, and when you get to the workshed, thomas indicates that it's empty, and that perhaps we should come back later.  then, you notice a sign that says wellsworth.  you can either go back to gordon's hill and watch the butterfly, or click on the sign that says wellsworth.  obviously, you click on the sign, and once you arrive at the station, there's a bucket of coal waiting.  click on the coal, and thomas thanks you.  then, you're transferred back to the contents page.  sir topham hatt offers an ""attaboy,"" and instructs you to click on the next chapter to continue the adventure.

you could literally go back and forth from gordon's hill, to the workshed, and back to wellsworth station without really knowing what you're supposed to do.  there is no map to direct you, or verbal prompts.  the video mentions that thomas is cold, and needs to warm his steambox, but it doesn't specifically tell you to find a bucket of coal.  the entire game plays in this manner, in story mode anyway.  it's like a wild goose chase with a lot of guessing about where you're supposed to go, and what you're supposed to do.  the cursor highlights the signs, and announces what the signs say, but the story mode frustrates little one's, because the objectives aren't clear.

thankfully, the instructions are thorough in activities mode.  the narration is encouraging, and offers assistance when in trouble.  when changing the difficulty setting, or when leaving the game, the narrator always prompt with, ""are you sure you want to leave the game?""  this question comes with a thumbs up for yes, and a thumbs down for no.  kids understand this, so i like this aspect of play.  when i first played thomas saves the day, i was confused.  now, i'm not into computer games, so that's not saying a lot; however, in my view a preschool game should be crystal clear.  this computer game is rated ec (early childhood), and is intended for the very young, 3 to 5-years.  most 3-year old children are not reading yet, so they need simple verbal prompts to assist them.  despite the aggravation with the story mode, william enjoyed the activities mode.  some of the games are more challenging than others, but for a 2-year old it was enough to keep him busy for 30-minutes or more.  as he became more confident, he attempted the chapters.  now that he's 4, he flies through the program.

i'm torn as to how to rate this game.  the graphics and sounds are exceptional = 5.  the narrative instruction is great in activities mode = 5, but ridiculously weak in story mode = 1.  the game entertains my son = 3, but lacks educational value = 3.  i'd like to give thomas saves the day an above average rating, because once my son got the hang of the game, he was quite amused by it, but the lack of direction in an early childhood game bothers me.  had atari designed the game with two levels of play in story mode, one with instruction, and one without, i probably would have rated this game excellent.  bottom line, an experience preschooler will probably like the challenge of the story mode, a beginner will be seriously frustrated.",1,software,story mode game seriously lack direction prompt instance watch video describe big storm introduction screen jump gordon hill sign say knapford another sign picture shed verbal prompt instruction butterfly flit air minute narrator say let check wellsworth station something heat steam sign wellsworth station click sign say knapford thomas say still feel bit cold train move click sign say jeb coal workshed get workshed thomas indicate empty perhaps come back later notice sign say wellsworth either go back gordon hill watch butterfly click sign say wellsworth obviously click sign arrive station bucket coal wait click coal thomas thanks transfer back content page sir topham hatt offer attaboy instructs click next chapter continue adventure could literally go back forth gordon hill workshed back wellsworth station without really know suppose map direct verbal prompt video mention thomas cold need warm steambox specifically tell find bucket coal entire game play manner story mode anyway like wild goose chase lot guess suppose go suppose cursor highlight sign announces sign say story mode frustrate little one objectives clear thankfully instruction thorough activity mode narration encourage offer assistance trouble change difficulty set leave game narrator always prompt sure want leave game question come thumbs yes thumbs kid understand like aspect play first play thomas save day confuse computer game say lot however view preschool game crystal clear computer game rat ec early childhood intend young 3 5years 3year old child read yet need simple verbal prompt assist despite aggravation story mode william enjoyed activity mode game challenge other 2year old enough keep busy 30minutes become confident attempted chapter 4 fly program tear rate game graphic sound exceptional = 5 narrative instruction great activity mode = 5 ridiculously weak story mode = 1 game entertains son = 3 lack educational value = 3 would like give thomas save day average rating son get hang game quite amuse lack direction early childhood game bother atari design game two level play story mode one instruction one without probably would rat game excellent bottom line experience preschooler probably like challenge story mode beginner seriously frustrate

"i bought the manufacturing and wholesale edition with the hope's of replacing our current system which involves two apps one for for invoicing, and one for inventory/boms/resource planning with a single application, that would also add connectivity to our online banking etc.

after getting quickbooks, which according to their marketing materials would be able to do everything we needed, i spent 1 week and over 9 hours on the phone with bank of america and quickbooks learning that the advertised direct connection functionality doesn't work as they claim it does, but *might* be up and running in a month. might work with other banks, but not mine. c'mon guys sort it out yesterday, it isn't that hard. strike one.

i also realized that the minimrp piece of software(the one we used previously), while small and somewhat cludgy in it's interface blows away qb premier in terms of boms, assemblies, etc.  the unit of measure functionality is a waste of time, as you have to enter everything in manually anyhow price-wise, and there is no notion of resource planning based on new sales orders for product. it is obvious that whomever developed the requirements for this supposed manufacturing and wholesale version doesn't actually know much about the existence of resource planning or actually how to leverage software to speed up tasks. similar to the software as a whole, this is better suited to someone that needs to take a paper business onto a computer, and not really change the way they actually work with all the various entities. waste of time for me, as even the minimrp trumps it out in functionality, and understanding of what is needed to manage inventory and streamline processes.(btw i am just a customer of minimrp and it just happens to sound like an ad compared to qb).

just as i realized that the qb was not going to be worth implementing, there was an update for minimrp that added multiple units of measure for purchasing/selling.. and with that, i returned quickbooks, and haven't looked back.

my best experience in the whole story was via amazon, and how easy they make returns, i was really impressed by how well their process actually works. i'm used to things more like my qb experience, perhaps partly function, maybe a good idea but poorly implemented, not well thought out, and with obviously lazy development. this was the case for quickbooks, but not for amazon. i assume that for current quickbooks users and accountants qb is great and might be why there is such a following, but in terms of living up to the potential it has, it's pathetic, and living up to what is advertised i feel the same way. it's not really misleading... but if it doesn't explicitly say it can do something in that big product comparison matrix.. don't count on it doing it. my advice, buy it from amazon if you must, that way if it doesn't work for you the return is easy. if you're a small tech savvy manufacturer, look at minimrp and a separate accounting software instead of qb premier m&w.  and to intuit, you guys should look at minimrp to so you have a clue as to how simple it would be to get even some basic mrp functionality that would make the software really worth having/paying for.",2,software,buy manufacture wholesale edition hope replace current system involve two apps one invoice one inventorybomsresource planning single application would also add connectivity online banking etc get quickbooks accord marketing material would able everything need spent 1 week 9 hour phone bank america quickbooks learn advertised direct connection functionality work claim * might * run month might work bank mine c amon guy sort yesterday hard strike one also realize minimrp piece softwarethe one use previously small somewhat cludgy interface blow away qb premier term boms assembly etc unit measure functionality waste time enter everything manually anyhow pricewise notion resource planning base new sale order product obvious whomever develop requirement suppose manufacture wholesale version actually know much existence resource plan actually leverage software speed task similar software whole well suit someone need take paper business onto computer really change way actually work various entity waste time even minimrp trumps functionality understand need manage inventory streamline processesbtw customer minimrp happen sound like ad compare qb realize qb go worth implement update minimrp add multiple unit measure purchasingselling return quickbooks look back best experience whole story via amazon easy make return really impressed well process actually work used thing like qb experience perhaps partly function maybe good idea poorly implement well think obviously lazy development case quickbooks amazon assume current quickbooks user accountant qb great might follow term live potential pathetic living advertise feel way really mislead explicitly say something big product comparison matrix count advice buy amazon must way work return easy small tech savvy manufacturer look minimrp separate accounting software instead qb premier & w intuit guy look minimrp clue simple would get even basic mrp functionality would make software really worth havingpaying

don't any of you get it?  this game is not coming out in november, no way, no how.  i bet all of you it's gonna come out sometime in spring 2005.  my reasons?  check it out:

1) valve is scared to release the game, because they know that the modding community could make money out of its ""brilliant"" creations.

2) the game is sooo complex that it will take a whopper of a computer to run.  valve's answer?  try and make the engine run on lower-spec computers, thus increasing preproduction time tenfold.

3) one word: competition.  it's taken so long for valve to get this stuff ready that the engine may look insignificant to upcoming games like tribes 3 and halo 2 (you all know it.  they have to make a pc version.)

"i've been a quicken user since 1993.  generally, i really love quicken so my perspective is that of a fan.  i've bought probably five versions over the years.  i tend to keep each version until intuit ""sunsets"" it by phasing out support.  since my last version was quicken 2007, it was now time to migrate to quicken 2010 premier.  after several weeks of use, here are my thoughts in a nutshell.

there are no really material changes to distinguish 2010 from 2007 that i've seen.  mostly the cosmetics have been changed, and some tabs have been added for navigation purposes.  as far as i'm concerned, this is fine since to me there is nothing more aggravating than becoming proficient at a useful application, and then having the publisher make major changes that force you to learn it all over again.  i'm still swearing daily over ms word 2007 and excel 2007 after microsoft radically changed the interfaces from the 2003 versions.

that said, i find one major irritant in quicken 2010.  when you enter a transaction into a register, the category must be selected from a window, and the window is too small.  if you're selecting from a second or third tier subcategory, the subcategories can't be read at all due to the narrowness of the window.  you can hover the cursor over the category list and see the subcategories, but if you try to select one after revealing it, only  the main category pops into the register.  this is a ridiculously sloppy oversight by intuit in my opinion and it makes entering transactions a real chore.  i have literally spent more than a minute trying to enter a single one-subcategory transaction that would have taken me two seconds in the old version.  something needs to be done about this!

i understand that intuit needs to prod its users to buy a new version occasionally and the product is generally so good i have no objection to this.  the only thing i ask is, make the new version no worse than the one i'm replacing!  intuit dropped the ball on the window size problem and this is why i rated it three out of five stars.",1,software,quicken user since 1993 generally really love quicken perspective fan buy probably five version year tend keep version intuit sunsets phase support since last version quicken 2007 time migrate quicken 2010 premier several week use thought nutshell really material change distinguish 2010 2007 see mostly cosmetic change tab added navigation purpose far concerned fine since nothing aggravate become proficient useful application publisher make major change force learn still swear daily m word 2007 excel 2007 microsoft radically change interface 2003 version say find one major irritant quicken 2010 enter transaction register category must select window window small select second third tier subcategory subcategories read due narrowness window hover cursor category list see subcategories try select one revealing main category pop register ridiculously sloppy oversight intuit opinion make enter transaction real chore literally spent minute try enter single onesubcategory transaction would take two second old version something need do understand intuit need prod user buy new version occasionally product generally good objection thing ask make new version bad one replace intuit drop ball window size problem rat three five star

"i have easily logged hundreds of hours in this game. i was totally new to video games and have only been playing this one for 9 months, but have to say that it's been an enriching experience. the first attraction was fear- i was afraid of the monsters, or ""ads,"" and afraid of dying. the goal was to overcome that fear. when i did, i turned to shotguns. and yes, you can walk around with two shotguns equipped if you want to and just shoot everything in the face. it's awesome. i even earned the nickname ""shotgun shirley"" after a time with my other die-hard destiny friends.

and speaking of friends... the friends! it is possible to make many. the game puts you in direct contact with other gamers, and encourages team work, which i absolutely love. there are certain levels that are impossible to beat without your buddies, and even if you could do it alone you wouldn't want to. destiny is a game about teamwork.

my only complaint is that after 9 months of playing almost every day, i am running out of content. bungie does a good job of coming up with new challenges and releasing new side quests every so often, but there is only so much of that you can do. and the raids... they are great if you and your 5 friends have 9 hours of dedicated time, which in reality you wouldn't expect to have available until it's already passed. and then slowly, over time, your friends will begin to lose interest and find new games, or other distractions. the world gets smaller.

i am not ready to completely retire destiny, as i still find great amusement in o_o 'ing my nightsalker around in the dirty, dirty dreadnaught, or self-reviving at unexpected moments during trials of osiris, or throwing myself off the tower for no reason with reckless abandon. however, i feel that perhaps i have had destiny, or that destiny has had me, and i'm ready to pursue the next challenge. i have to say that i will be waiting with baited breath for the next thing that bungie makes, because if it is even half as fun as this game it will be worth playing.",0,game,easily log hundred hour game totally new video game play one 9 month say enrich experience first attraction fear afraid monster ad afraid die goal overcome fear turn shotguns yes walk around two shotgun equip want shoot everything face awesome even earn nickname shotgun shirley time diehard destiny friend speak friend friends possible make many game put direct contact gamer encourage team work absolutely love certain level impossible beat without buddy even could alone would want destiny game teamwork complaint 9 month play almost every day run content bungie good job come new challenge release new side quest every often much raid great 5 friend 9 hour dedicated time reality would expect available already pass slowly time friend begin lose interest find new game distraction world get small ready completely retire destiny still find great amusement o_o ing nightsalker around dirty dirty dreadnaught selfreviving unexpected moment trial osiris throw tower reason reckless abandon however feel perhaps destiny destiny ready pursue next challenge say wait bait breath next thing bungie make even half fun game worth play

"this game is truly a masterpiece throughout 99% of my time spent playing it. i was mesmerized by the locales, entranced by the sounds and overtures, made to laugh and cry at encounters with friends found and lost. i was completely enveloped by the game and i didn't stop playing, not even to bother looking at the multiplayer portion.

the story: if you haven't played the first two installations of the series, stop reading and go buy those now. anyone else, continue on. the story is gripping and compelling. you will encounter scenes that will fill you with pure joy as you find former companions struggling against the reaper threat. forced to leave earth, you are left with the task of creating an army that can rival the reaper forces, and your friends are there from day one reminding you why you are in love with the series, let alone this singular game. though at times the story may seem bleak, there are always opportunities to shine a little ray of hope that all is not lost, and that you will fight (and play) until the very end.

the sound: the guns have gotten a new set of sounds this time around, and while at first they might be out of place, you'll find yourself humming along to your avenger as you tear down enemies; laughing as your claymore cleaves brutes, guardians and primes alike; and silently smiling at the osok as your widow plows down weaklings and gods alike. the score is beautifully orchestrated, making each moment of the story that much more compelling, and tugging at your heartstrings when appropriate. i'll admit, i was moved to tears by what i witnessed. the voice acting is of course, phenomenal. mordin's dire need for salvation can be heard in every sentence, his remorse driving him forward; liara's dread that she alone will leave to see the end, if all else fails, will make you wish you could comfort her yourself.

the gameplay: don't stop; you stop, you're dead. every shot counts, ammo isn't freely given and your powers count, whether techs, biotics or simple grenades, even more so than in previous installments. your squadmates have gotten boosts since the second game, don't expect them to be falling as much, and even if they do you can now revive them manually, rather than waste precious medi-gel. tactics are more important, especially on insanity where a careful combination of overload, then a pull, followed by a warp detonation could spell victory. weapon deployment is much more versatile than before, though some classes will directly benefit one way or another from specific loadouts.

so why only the 3/5 stars for the overall game? ***spoilers***

the ending(s) are rubbish. everything after anderson's speech on how shepard is the best than any person could hope to serve with, is rubbish. it lacks any ingenuity and completely takes away the elements that made the mass effect series what it is today. when faced with the ultimate decision as to how to eliminate the reapers, shepard is unable to, in any way, shape or form, deny anything that the starchild says is true about organic and synthetic coexistence. are the quarians and geth working together to build rannoch? doesn't matter. edi and joker madly in love? doesn't matter. no matter what evidence to the contrary, you must decide between three choices that just don't add up, without questioning any of it. even when you do make a choice, the differences between the three are really just red, blue or green, as the resulting explosion of the citadel emanates a light across the universe.

finally, the final cutscene. joker, running away from the fight with the rest of your crew (including those who went with you to charge into the citadel), and crash land on a remote jungle planet. let me just state that this is the most despicable plot hole in the story. let me explain. joker has vrolik's syndrome, or better known as brittle-bone disease. he has fought tooth and nail to show that he can be just as good if not better than any pilot in the mass effect universe. he fought through flight school, taunted by his fellow cadets, but he never gave up. he fought to show that he was better than any of them, in the air, in space, wherever; just to show that he's the best pilot to get the hell out of dodge? i will not accept that any person who strives to show how dedicated he is, how skilled he is, would just run off at the first sign of trouble. let alone, he somehow manages to get your teammates from the battlefield while simultaneously fighting reaper forces in orbit around earth.

"so my original xbox receiver that i bought a few years ago gave up on me and stopped working at all. i decided to go to amazon and find a replacement and this one is the first one that came out in the search. the price was very reasonable (under $13 at time of writing) and silly me, went ahead and bought it with next day prime delivery.

so the receiver arrives and... is encased in a weird plastic cover with a red cardboard insert, nothing like the normal xbox peripherals with the white and green theme. i opened it and sure enough, the build quality is... passable but not great. the bottom side has a rubber ring that is meant for not sliding on the table and one corner is bent weirdly and peeling off. also the underside ""hologram"" is nothing but a sticker with badly printed colored flakes. the cable also is flimsy and very long (which can be a positive or negative i presume).

i plugged the receiver in my pc and proceeded to install it and i had no problems at all. so the receiver does indeed work as expected. it paired with my original xbox 360 controller without much trouble and it's been fine ever since. i am keeping it for the things i do (play steam games mostly with controller, perfect for that) while i wait microsoft to release a proper driver for the xbox one controller.

the build quality leaves quite a lot to be desired. so if you are looking for a cheap receiver this is probably it but don't expect top notch quality or it being a 100% original msft product.",1,game,original xbox receiver buy year ago give stop work decide go amazon find replacement one first one come search price reasonable $ 13 time write silly go ahead buy next day prime delivery receiver arrive encased weird plastic cover red cardboard insert nothing like normal xbox peripheral white green theme open sure enough build quality passable great bottom side rubber ring meant slide table one corner bent weirdly peel also underside hologram nothing sticker badly print colored flake cable also flimsy long positive negative presume plug receiver pc proceed install problem receiver indeed work expect paired original xbox 360 controller without much trouble fine ever since keep thing play steam game mostly controller perfect wait microsoft release proper driver xbox one controller build quality leave quite lot desire look cheap receiver probably expect top notch quality 100 % original msft product

"i'll admit it - i'm a video game addict who needs to get in better shape.  thank god for wii fit!

i'm not going to say that wii fit is perfect, but it is definitely something that helps me stay on track.  i'm at day 252 now, and i can definitely see a difference in my center of balance and my aerobic capacity.  and i get to have fun while i'm doing it!

i really like the way the wii fit keeps track of your workouts, weight, and bmi, and it's also great that they allow you to earn fit credits for activities you participate in outside of wii fit.  that way, you get a more accurate picture of what your active lifestyle looks like.  on the other hand, i could do without the repetitive chatter of the balance board character during the daily body test portion.  (i have discovered that pressing the a button even before he finishes can hurry the process along a little bit.)  another problem with the system is the fact that you have to engage in certain exercises for a period of time before others will be unlocked.  while this makes some sense, insofar as you don't want to start with the most difficult exercises first, i don't understand, for example, why free run (set your own pace and run for a specific time period) takes so long to unlock.  how they come up with your wii fit age is still a mystery to me, as well.

one point that does bother me is the steadiness test.  physically, we are always in motion, even if it is only as the result of breathing.  to make someone think that it is possible to maintain total stillness is setting people up for failure.  i am also concerned with the number of children using the product, since the overweight and obese labels could cause emotional trauma. (eeven though the documentation makes it clear that those labels don't apply to anyone under 21, to hear yourself called obese on a daily basis still takes its toll.)

overall, i am pleased with the product.  i do find myself using it everyday, mostly because it tells me how much i weigh and allows me to track the factors that contribute to my weight. and i particularly enjoy the aerobics and the balance games.  for a video game addict like me, that's a real positive!",1,game,admit video game addict need get good shape thank god wii fit go say wii fit perfect definitely something help stay track day 252 definitely see difference center balance aerobic capacity get fun really like way wii fit keep track workout weight bmi also great allow earn fit credit activity participate outside wii fit way get accurate picture active lifestyle look like hand could without repetitive chatter balance board character daily body test portion discover press button even finish hurry process along little bit another problem system fact engage certain exercise period time other unlocked make sense insofar want start difficult exercise first understand example free run set pace run specific time period take long unlock come wii fit age still mystery well one point bother steadiness test physically always motion even result breathe make someone think possible maintain total stillness set people failure also concern number child use product since overweight obese label could cause emotional trauma eeven though documentation make clear label apply anyone 21 hear call obese daily basis still take toll overall pleased product find use everyday mostly tell much weigh allow track factor contribute weight particularly enjoy aerobics balance game video game addict like real positive

"first time i completed a 1065 for my two llcs myself.  i found the interview questions to be inadequate, had to frequently switch to forms mode to figure things out.  in fact, by the end, i was working only with the forms mode so that i could sort out what was supposed to happen.  not much different than just completing pdf forms.  needed a lot of tax knowledge - which meant i had to acquire it.  so you have to know what you are doing - or be prepared to spend a lot of time waiting on phone.  oh - i started calling them in february through march and on into april - so the rush should not have been there.  (my opinion - hi call volume and long waits means poor product and/or poor support planning)

tt triages their support calls.  that means you can't get to a business cpa until you go through the same group that handles the personal or technical stuff too - i.e. you need to be referred.  not what i expected when i bought the business product (most expensive). once you get to a business cpa though - they are good and helpful.  but i did not expect to be so dependent on them - especially having to often depend on them to how to interpret what tt was asking.

i had expected much better from tt - i guess it was better than dealing with irs forms directly.  (who invented our tax system - what a drain on us productivity)

 i will be looking for alternative products in 2013.  i would suggest anyone doing a better comparative analysis than i did.  i just went with tt because they were a trusted entity for me.  someone has to be doing the biz stuff better.  i'd pay more just to know if i had a question i wouldn't be waiting more than 2 hours - sometimes days - for an answer or a call back.

tt does keep cpas in business though - no insults intended to that fine profession.  very thankful they are there as long as there is an irs.",2,software,first time complete 1065 two llcs find interview question inadequate frequently switch form mode figure thing fact end work form mode could sort suppose happen much different complete pdf form need lot tax knowledge meant acquire know prepare spend lot time wait phone oh start call february march april rush opinion hi call volume long wait mean poor product andor poor support plan tt triage support call mean get business cpa go group handle personal technical stuff ie need refer expect bought business product expensive get business cpa though good helpful expect dependent especially often depend interpret tt ask expect much well tt guess well deal irs form directly invent tax system drain u productivity look alternative product 2013 would suggest anyone well comparative analysis go tt trust entity someone biz stuff well would pay know question would wait 2 hour sometimes day answer call back tt keep cpa business though insult intend fine profession thankful long irs

"i was super excited about this game. after the last two or three spider-man titles had abandoned the open world, i was incredibly excited for someone to finally bring it back. after all, if you played spider-man 2 or 3, your favorite part of the game was probably the web-slinging around manhattan, am i right? well, this game does bring back the web-slinging and the open world, but it looks like the devs couldn't be bothered to look at (or didn't have access to) the code from spider-man 2 or 3. the open world web slinging is a joke. the problem is, your webs don't actually attach to anything! you can actually web-sling about 5 stories higher than the tallest sky-scraper in sight, and the webs just shoot straight up (this should sound familiar to anyone who played spider-man 1 on the xbox)! this might make sense if manhattan was covered by a large dome or something, but it's not, and it just comes off as hacky and super-lame.

sure the combat looks pretty cool (feels like arkham asylum), but without the web slinging fun, who really cares? personally, i played the tutorial indoor level, and as soon as i got outside and tried out the web-slinging for a few minutes, i turned the game off (and popped in spider-man 3 to get my web-slinging fix). maybe i'll give it another chance at some point, but honestly, it's probably going straight to gamestop for a trade-in while it's still worth something.

"in super mario 64 the only ""difficult"" part for me was getting mario to swim underwater.  otherwise, jumping, leaping, flipping, wall kicks - all were fairly straightforward and my controller controlled them as expected.  also, all the baddies in that game were pretty straightforward and reacted as you'd expect when mario punched, kicked, whatver, them.
however, in super mario sunshine, possibly because of the water involved, i find it very awkward to control the water pack.  there are initially three modes for shooting water with the water pack.  method 1 is to use the double nozzle, which makes mario hover over the goo and squirts downward.  method 2, harder to do, supposedly works by using the single nozzle, holding the r button down until it's all the way down.  this is supposed to make mario stand still and squirt water.  but whenever i do this, instead of squirting at my target, mario turns around, looking all around him (although his feet do stay in one place), and as he turns the water stream turns with him, so that i am not squirting at the target anymore.  and method 3 is by far the hardest; this involves holding the r button down just a little, which means mario can squirt while he runs.  this is very bad because his water stream doesn't stay focused on the targets, but wildly shoots all around the area, wasting water and time.
also, with one of the baddies in this game being a sort of toxic goop, it's much harder to deal with than a straightforward guy like (say) bowser.  this goop is runny and flows around mario and sometimes even with a good on-target squirting it doesn't go away, just washes downstream (or whatever) to make an even bigger pile of goop.
i loved super mario 64 but i can't seem to get past the third stage of this game, and i've only got 4 stars so far (after maybe 30 hours of play).  luckily my 3-year-old son is happy to simply maneuver mario around and squirt things, or the game would be sitting idle on the shelf.",1,game,super mario 64 difficult part get mario swim underwater otherwise jump leap flip wall kick fairly straightforward controller control expect also baddies game pretty straightforward react would expect mario punch kick whatver however super mario sunshine possibly water involve find awkward control water pack initially three mode shoot water water pack method 1 use double nozzle make mario hover goo squirt downward method 2 harder supposedly work use single nozzle hold r button way suppose make mario stand still squirt water whenever instead squirt target mario turn around look around although foot stay one place turn water stream turn squirt target anymore method 3 far hard involves hold r button little mean mario squirt run bad water stream stay focus target wildly shoot around area waste water time also one baddie game sort toxic goop much hard deal straightforward guy like say bowser goop runny flow around mario sometimes even good ontarget squirt go away wash downstream whatever make even big pile goop love super mario 64 seem get past third stage game get 4 star far maybe 30 hour play luckily 3yearold son happy simply maneuver mario around squirt thing game would sit idle shelf

i was looking for a keyboard for my 1st gen surface pro and i didn't want another type cover, i wanted a compact keyboard to carry with me if i need to but not really a tkl beacause im an engineer and i use the keypad a lot so for me this layout is perfect. and after 3 weeks i'm satisfied enough with the keyboard to take the time to write a review. i like details, i design things for a living and details are important for me, you will find a lot of them in the review probalby to many but in my opinion they can make or brake a decision. here we go.

i'm going to forget for a moment about some things you can find in every 7 minutes youtube video about the keyboard, and focus on the things i didn't find while doing my research and some personal thoughts. i use it 3 weeks non stop just because i liked it right out of the box. it has a nice and soft feel everywhere, no cheap plastic exposed, it has some weight but can be picked up with one hand if you want to, i shook it and twisted a little and there was no flex, no funny noices or indication that something was loose inside. the case itself is nice, no gaps, no sharp edges as expected, the line between the top and botom half of the case can barely be seen, and more important is even across the case meannig the components inside are not producing forces agains the case. what was really a surprise for me whas the cable, braided, long and detachable, if it was micro usb to usb, instead of mini usb to usb i'll use it for everything, its gold plated and thick, thicker than my $200 ""ultimate super premuim flashy look at me rgb mechamichal gaming"" keyboard by some iron company.

the layout takes sometime to get used to but its not a big deal, one thing i noticed is the numpad/arrow are closer, of course there is a whole portion of a normal keyboard missing, but i ment the normal distance between the right control, shift and enter and the keys to the right, you don't see it until you reach the keys by feel, not by much, its really a tiny distance, it took some time to find the difference and then compare it to a standard keyboard, after a day and a half i was typing the same way and the same speed as every other keyboard and now i can change keyboards without problems. things start getting interesting here, you can swtich between function and f keys for the top row of the keyboard, if you hold th fn key for 3 seconds until its lit and the functions becomes the primary use of the top row, this way you don't need to hold fn plus the f key you want to execute a function like change volume or track in the media player, but it doesn't work the other way around, if the media and keyboard functions are the top row primary functions (when fn is lit) pressing fn plus something in the top row will not register as f4 or f5 etc, you need to disable the permanent fn function first (press fn until is not lit) to get access to those keys. another thing you will find confusing is scroll lock, if you are using the number pad you need to get out of the numpad to get access to the scroll lock key as it is shared with the * symbol in the number pad, same thing with pause and other keys, its just part of the way the layout is.

the lights; i didn't buy it for the lights but they are beautiful, they work well with the keyboard, sure they match a gaming pc just fine but even in my office with the lights on it looks ok, i don't feel like a 14 years old, it has 3 modes: 1.- on, 2.- wasd and arrows keys only which is useless, 3.- breathing that is also useless for me but i left the keyboard like that for a couple of days just to test the leds and make sure none was failing.
it was anoying at first that with the numpad active the 2, 0, 00 and period keys were not lit, i thought it was a poor design choice until i was using the keyboard with my tablet and no lights to save battery, and thats when it striked me, its ment be used with no lights, in that moment i had a clean keyboard with just the numlock led indicator at the top and if i turn off numlock and switch to the arrows just the arrows were lit to show me my way on the keyboard, the moment i understood why the keyboard is this way that little complain stopped. another thing that helps the keyboard with the lights are the keycaps, i have seen other reviews here saying that other cm keyboards have better keycaps and thats true but they compare it to non backlit keyboards and there is a huge difference, non backlit keycaps can be dense and robust, backlit keycaps need to be made of a material that can let the light pass and also have to be thinner because of this, and im really pleased with the quality of the keycaps, they are better by far than the keycaps of a corsair k70 rgb i can tell you that much, i even swapped a few of them to confirm it, the rubber finish is nice, the font could be better but its not terrible, i really just dislike the ""a"" of the font. the keycaps let a lot more light go through the keycap compared with other keyboards i have and the backplate also helps.

doing research before buying there were some bugs with the keyboard, some leds dying, a problem with the 00 key and ghosting, the right enter key not always working and some random stuff, in my unit all this has been fixed, model sgk-4020-gkcm3-us, the original model was cm1 so i guess mine is revision 3 of the keyboard but im not sure, and beware im talking about the model with brown switches and white leds,  but so far i haven't found any bugs or problems, plug and play, all pcs can see it without problems but i haven't tested it outside windows: old bios, linux or mac.

its a really nice keyboard, its not perfect, its everything i need even if it is not everything i want, it has its details that you have to learn to live with but for me none of this details get in my way to enjoy the keyboard or to brake the experience, and thats the point, i couldn't be happier about my purchase, of course is not the best keyboard ever but price to performace this is really an excelent product and i'm keeping this one in my back pack and getting another one with blue or green switches just to drive everyone insane at the office",0,game,tk brown switch white led buy amazon mexico product amazon u offer import service add custom fee even web page say item sell ship amazon u look keyboard 1st gen surface pro want another type cover want compact keyboard carry need really tkl beacause im engineer use keypad lot layout perfect 3 week satisfy enough keyboard take time write review like detail design thing live detail important find lot review probalby many opinion make brake decision go go forget moment thing find every 7 minute youtube video keyboard focus thing find research personal thought use 3 week non stop like right box nice soft feel everywhere cheap plastic expose weight pick one hand want shook twist little flex funny noices indication something loose inside case nice gap sharp edge expect line top botom half case barely see important even across case meannig component inside produce force again case really surprise whas cable braid long detachable micro usb usb instead mini usb usb use everything gold plat thick thicker $ 200 ultimate super premuim flashy look rgb mechamichal game keyboard iron company layout take sometime get use big deal one thing notice numpadarrow closer course whole portion normal keyboard miss ment normal distance right control shift enter key right see reach key feel much really tiny distance take time find difference compare standard keyboard day half type way speed every keyboard change keyboard without problem thing start get interest swtich function f key top row keyboard hold th fn key 3 second lit function becomes primary use top row way need hold fn plus f key want execute function like change volume track medium player work way around medium keyboard function top row primary function fn lit pressing fn plus something top row register f4 f5 etc need disable permanent fn function first press fn light get access key another thing find confuse scroll lock use number pad need get numpad get access scroll lock key share * symbol number pad thing pause key part way layout light buy light beautiful work well keyboard sure match game pc fine even office light look ok feel like 14 year old 3 mode 1 2 wasd arrow key useless 3 breathing also useless leave keyboard like couple day test led make sure none fail anoying first numpad active 2 0 00 period key light think poor design choice use keyboard tablet light save battery thats strike ment use light moment clean keyboard numlock lead indicator top turn numlock switch arrows arrows lit show way keyboard moment understood keyboard way little complain stop another thing help keyboard light keycaps see review say cm keyboard well keycaps thats true compare non backlit keyboard huge difference non backlit keycaps dense robust backlit keycaps need make material let light pas also thinner im really pleased quality keycaps well far keycaps corsair k70 rgb tell much even swap confirm rubber finish nice font could well terrible really dislike font keycaps let lot light go keycap compare keyboard backplate also help research buying bug keyboard led die problem 00 key ghost right enter key always work random stuff unit fix model sgk4020gkcm3us original model cm1 guess mine revision 3 keyboard im sure beware im talk model brown switch white led far find bug problem plug play pc see without problem test outside window old bios linux mac really nice keyboard perfect everything need even everything want detail learn live none detail get way enjoy keyboard brake experience thats point could happier purchase course best keyboard ever price performace really excel product keep one back pack get another one blue green switch drive everyone insane office

"so far, i'm quite disappointed with this software, for three reasons:
1. out of the box, the hotkey feature does not work in os x 10.2.  the trick is to download the 2.01 upgrade and the hotkeys patch.  now, i'm a computing professional.  my guess is that ma and pa won't think about downloading upgrades as soon as they get home from the store.  all commercial software should have an auto-update feature that alerts end users of newer versions.  it's just too simple of a feature to leave out.  the browser grab feature works only with internet explorer.  netscape navigator or mozilla fans won't be able to use it.
2. the application's usability is poor.
a. for one, it's obtrusive. where apple sticky notes is simple and uncluttered (from a user interface standpoint), stickybrain provides way too many configuration options on their toolbars (they have three toolbars!). sure, i can click on the desktop to make the entire application hide, but there's just too much presented on the toolbars.  to be effective, only the most critical options should be provided as shortcuts. i'm not even sure if i would use toolbars if i were designing this application. but that's just me...
b. they also don't need as many options for setting look-and-feel. for something that's supposed to simplify my life, it sure does distract me with more decisions on how to decorate my stickies. i can see lots of busy people wasting time monkeying around with their sticky colors and/or textures.
c. also, if you don't place your toolbars properly, new notes sometimes get created underneath a toolbar. very annoying.  my suggestions: make the toolbars configurable, like vertical or horizontal orientation and removing buttons you don't need.
3. it doesn't import os x format sticky notes! the documentation blathers something about incompatible file formats, but that's only because they don't know what the sticky note file format is. my guess is that they're unwilling to invest in the file conversion technology to make this happen.
conclusion: one word -- usability.  chronos needs to tighten up this package for it to provide the seamless, integrated features it advertises on the box.  it's fine for techies that know enough to look for ugprades and tweak the operating system to auto-launch this app.  novices will be frustrated trying to get it to work.  once you're set up though, it's a fine upgrade to sticky notes.",1,software,far quite disappointed software three reason 1 box hotkey feature work os x 102 trick download 201 upgrade hotkeys patch compute professional guess pa think download upgrade soon get home store commercial software autoupdate feature alert end user newer version simple feature leave browser grab feature work internet explorer netscape navigator mozilla fan able use 2 application usability poor one obtrusive apple sticky note simple uncluttered user interface standpoint stickybrain provide way many configuration option toolbars three toolbars sure click desktop make entire application hide much present toolbars effective critical option provide shortcut even sure would use toolbars design application b also need many option set lookandfeel something suppose simplify life sure distract decision decorate stickies see lots busy people waste time monkey around sticky color andor texture c also place toolbars properly new note sometimes get created underneath toolbar annoy suggestion make toolbars configurable like vertical horizontal orientation remove button need 3 import o x format sticky note documentation blather something incompatible file format know sticky note file format guess unwilling invest file conversion technology make happen conclusion one word usability chronos need tighten package provide seamless integrate feature advertise box fine techie know enough look ugprades tweak operate system autolaunch app novice frustrate try get work set though fine upgrade sticky note

"as a woman, most of us have multiple pairs of shoes to compliment the outfits we wear daily, but unfortunately for me, i have a foot that i have had a few surgeries on to correct an issue with my toes growing crooked causing pain on a regular basis- especially painful in certain styles and/or brands of shoes.  the problem is - when i purchase my new shoes, they feel a absolutely great walking around in the store, however, once i get home and wear them a few days, on some shoes/boots i start to get pain from where my toes are rubbing against the side of my toes, which of naturally means i have to try on every pair of shoes before purchase:(  over the years,  i've tried sizing up, getting wider shoes and even wearing corn/bunion protectors on the effected toes, yet nothing helps.  as a last ditch effort, i found this on amazon and after reading the reviews- (which are so tremendously appreciated by the way!) , i decided i would give this a try to help on the pairs that at least cause me the most pain.  first of all, this item arrived immediately- kudos to the seller!! but in all fairness, there are both pros and cons to the foot fitter.
pros:
comes in a very nice box that is awesome for storage when not in use (for those of us we are particular about shoes and item storage)
this stretcher is constructed of good quality, actual wood, not some flimsy plastic.  fairly easy to use, which mine arrived with instructions for use, which is wonderful for someone if you have never used a shoe/boot stretcher.  although this is called a 'boot stretcher', it does work in shoes as well.  the first item i tried to stretch was a long pair of lace up boots that simply must have had a design flaw because both the left and right boots were extremely tight both across the top and in the sides of the toe area which i started to notice like the third time i put them on.  i also purchased the kiwi universal shoe stretching spray, so i generously sprayed the inside of the boot and put in the foot fitter, hoping for the best.  on my boots, with the tightness of the leather, i had to stretch them a little at a time as to no ruin the boots.  to my surprise, low and behold, the foot fitter did the trick!  now granite, with my particular issue, the boot is still a tiny bit tight, but nothing that is unbearable and/or to complain about but i was fearful to keep stretcher and ruining one of my favorite pair of all boots.  keep in mind, shoe/boot leather can only give so much so don't expect to gain like 2 sizes or anything with this- but yes- it definitely works, depending on your shoes and needs. i could literally hear the leather stretching each time that i opened it wider, which concerned me at first, but then i realized, this was a good sound, as it meant that it was working.  for those particular boots, i left the stretcher in for two days, moving it just a tiny bit every few hours as the boots were expensive and i was fearful as to what the stretcher may do to them.
cons:
ok- lets be honest.  in this day and age when money is a concern for most of our daily purchases, the cost of this stretcher is a slightly high, however, being that it is more expensive and time consuming to find a cobbler (can you even find one now or days?) and/or countless hours traveling to shoe stores to find that perfect pair of shoes.  so for the money, its almost a wash- depending on how you look at it. just remember, you get what you pay for.  the second 'con; is that it does not stay tight in the toe of the boot, so depending on what area of the item you need stretched, this could be an issue.  for me, i need the area near the tip of the shoe, directly on the side where your pinky toe is, so this was a problem. i tried using the included plastic bunion accessory but it was as if the pre-drilled holes are not close enough to the tip to do what i needed it to do or just the design of how the stretcher opens, it was not working for what i needed.  so to compensate, i would open the stretcher slighter and just push very hard on the base to insure that the entire stretcher would stay tightly in the tip.  for some of my shoes, this was a bit of a chore, but i do not think it simply depends on what particular issue you have with you feet.  needless to say, i got the desired result i wanted after a true battle with some of the pairs of shoes i own.  the next 'con' is that this stretcher does not do length, only width, so depending on the design on the shoe (like very narrow or extremely high heels)  it was a little bit of a struggle to get this in place.  so.... if you have very high, narrow boots, you may be slightly disappointed- for me, all of my high arched boots/shoes have zippers on the side, making the larger wooden base work ok, but if you are someone who has a lot of narrow shoes, this may not fit that well, as the larger part of the base is probably the size of a small apple. just a side note, be careful when you are turning this- i thought i had broken it after like the 2nd day but my husband had to show me that i was trying to open it too wide, causing the handle to literally unscrew from the base- so keep that it mind.
all in all- i highly recommend this stretcher- i only gave it four stars because i would have liked to have seen the pre-drilled holes closer to the toes and due to the fact that i had to be 'hercules' to push it high enough into the toe area for my particular needs, but because i did end up with the results that i needed (after painstaking hours of doing all of my undesired fitting shoes) i have to say i am pleased with the purchase and urge you to consider it - reading all the reviews similar to what your needs are.  also, should mention, this is very universal- will work in both left or right side of most boots and shoes. you may also want to look at the stretching sprays- i'm not sure if i would have went without it.",0,fashion,woman u multiple pair shoe compliment outfit wear daily unfortunately foot surgery correct issue toe grow crook cause pain regular basis especially painful certain style andor brand shoe problem purchase new shoe feel absolutely great walk around store however get home wear day shoesboots start get pain toe rub side toe naturally mean try every pair shoe purchasefrown_sad_andry_or_pouting year try size get wider shoe even wear cornbunion protector effect toe yet nothing help last ditch effort find amazon read review tremendously appreciate way decide would give try help pair least cause pain first item arrive immediately kudos seller fairness pros con foot fitter pro come nice box awesome storage use u particular shoe item storage stretcher construct good quality actual wood flimsy plastic fairly easy use mine arrive instruction use wonderful someone never use shoeboot stretcher although call boot stretcher work shoe well first item tried stretch long pair lace boot simply must design flaw leave right boot extremely tight across top side toe area start notice like third time put also purchase kiwi universal shoe stretch spray generously spray inside boot put foot fitter hop best boot tightness leather stretch little time ruin boot surprise low behold foot fitter trick granite particular issue boot still tiny bit tight nothing unbearable andor complain fearful keep stretcher ruin one favorite pair boot keep mind shoeboot leather give much expect gain like 2 size anything yes definitely work depend shoe need could literally hear leather stretching time open wider concern first realize good sound mean work particular boot leave stretcher two day move tiny bit every hour boot expensive fearful stretcher may con ok let honest day age money concern daily purchase cost stretcher slightly high however expensive time consume find cobbler even find one day andor countless hour travel shoe store find perfect pair shoe money almost wash depend look remember get pay second con stay tight toe boot depend area item need stretch could issue need area near tip shoe directly side pinky toe problem try use include plastic bunion accessory predrilled hole close enough tip need design stretcher open work need compensate would open stretcher slighter push hard base insure entire stretcher would stay tightly tip shoes bit chore think simply depend particular issue foot needless say get desired result want true battle pair shoe next con stretcher length width depend design shoe like narrow extremely high heel little bit struggle get place high narrow boot may slightly disappointed high arch bootsshoes zipper side make large wooden base work ok someone lot narrow shoe may fit well large part base probably size small apple side note careful turn thought break like 2nd day husband show try open wide cause handle literally unscrew base keep mind highly recommend stretcher give four star would like see predrilled hole closer toe due fact hercules push high enough toe area particular need end result need painstaking hour undesired fit shoe say pleased purchase urge consider read review similar need also mention universal work leave right side boot shoe may also want look stretch spray sure would go without

"i purchased this game the day that it came out. i have been a fan of the resident evil series from the beginning. this game and resident evil 0 (now coming out for the gamecube) are two of the main reasons i bought an n64. however when i got the game home and started playing it, i immediately found some things that bothered me. while in general re2 is a very good port of the playstation version it has some problems that the ps version didn't. the first problem, and the biggest one, is the controller. the game was built around the ps controller and capcom didn't take the proper time to rework the control scheme too well. the design of the n64 controller makes it hard for people to easily access all of the buttons. in a game like this all the buttons need to be accessible. while after a while you will get more or less used to the controls, it still doesn't feel right, and i feel this holds the game back a chunk.
the second problem, albeit a small(er) one is the fact that you can change the colour of the blood that is in the game. it's a neat idea that just doesn't work. if you've played any of the rest of the series and know exactly what's going on, you know there's absolutely no reason for the zombies to bleed green. humans, even after they're dead, don't bleed green.
it was quite impressive that capcom managed to port all of the fmvs from the ps game onto the n64 cart, and they did a good job of it too. unfortunately due to the type of media the n64 uses the fmvs just aren't as good as the ps game's.
if you have an expansion pack in your system it can actually make the game look better than originally which is nice. it does a good job of this and hats off to capcom for enabling this to work.
to sum it all up:
-if you have a ps and an n64 buy the ps version.
-if you just have an n64 and want to be able to kill lots of zombies and other creatures, and don't mind get incrdibly frustrated with the controller then by all means buy this version

"i have to say, i was really excited for this expansion pack (regardless of some of the lackluster packs we've been getting lately). it brought me back to the original sims: superstar, one of my favorite original packs. and the sims 3 has had some good packs out so far (pets, ambitions, world adventures) in my opinion! but showtime doesn't really cut it.

the new town is nice. i like it. the new premade houses are nice and actually kind of spacious instead of being awkwardly shaped or sized. some of the job locations are now melded into one big building - for instance, say, science and medicine in the same building, not a separate hospital and science institute (that's just an out-of-nowhere example, not factual from the game). it's a little different,  but still okay. one thing this town is surely not lacking is entertainment venues. which is, you know, the whole point. i'd give the new town 4/5 stars.

there are some okay new hairstyles and clothing options too. not the best, but by far not some of the worst i've seen. as far as new traits go, i've only seen three: diva, born performer, and social butterfly. i immediately tried out the diva and social butterfly traits - and boy, is social butterfly annoying! if they aren't constantly talking to people, they get a negative moodlet. my sim will wake up and have an automatic negative moodlet just from not talking to people in her sleep. that's a little ridiculous. diva, i'm enjoying a little more, mainly because of other sims' reactions to my sim's divalicious interactions, haha. altogether, the new create-a-sim stuff, i'd give 3/5 stars.

the new careers seem interesting, and i was excited to try them out. my only problem is that they're professions - not careers. you get a weekly stipend and go out and perform randomly when you get the opportunity. that's not necessarily a bad thing, and for those jobs, i understand it's probably more realistic, but i prefer the jobs to professions. i'd give the new jobs 4/5 stars.

so why did i give the game 3 stars and not 4? well, it's simple - had late night and showtime been combined, i think they would've made a killer expansion pack. as it is, there simply aren't enough new features in showtime. some of the items you get in showtime, i think you should've gotten in late night. had they put the showtime stuff in with late night, everything would've fit perfectly. there's just not enough here to constitute a new expansion pack, in my opinion. don't get me wrong - the stuff is cool, and if you're a true fan, like me, you'll buy the game anyways. but be warned - it's probably going to be less new stuff and things to explore than you're used to.",1,game,say really excited expansion pack regardless lackluster pack get lately bring back original sims superstar one favorite original pack sims 3 good pack far pet ambition world adventure opinion showtime really cut new town nice like new premade house nice actually kind spacious instead awkwardly shaped size job location meld one big building instance say science medicine building separate hospital science institute outofnowhere example factual game little different still okay one thing town surely lack entertainment venue know whole point would give new town 45 star okay new hairstyle clothe option best far bad see far new trait go see three diva bear performer social butterfly immediately try diva social butterfly trait boy social butterfly annoy constantly talk people get negative moodlet sim wake automatic negative moodlet talk people sleep little ridiculous diva enjoy little mainly sims reaction sim divalicious interaction haha altogether new createasim stuff would give 35 star new career seem interest excite try problem profession career get weekly stipend go perform randomly get opportunity necessarily bad thing job understand probably realistic prefer job profession would give new job 45 star give game 3 star 4 well simple late night showtime combine think would make killer expansion pack simply enough new feature showtime item get showtime think get late night put showtime stuff late night everything would fit perfectly enough constitute new expansion pack opinion get wrong stuff cool true fan like buy game anyways warn probably go less new stuff thing explore use

its a third person shooter, but you constantly have to go into battle mode to control not only yourself but the other two agents that are always with you.  so every mission feels much longer than it should, even the minor missions.  you can rank up fellow agents, but while i was playing i really found that i liked two agents because of their skills over the others and once i had everyone ranked up to their max, kept using the two that i liked the most.  when you're deploying the special abilities, its annoying because in order to place something, you have to move the item as if you were walking around verses just moving something into its spot.  its stupid.

pretty much after every mission, you end up back at xcom base where you can run around to certain areas and talk to certain npc which they may or may not open up a new mission.  also the voice work is really lame, half the time i can't tell if the  main guy is shocked, mad, joking...its all the same voice.  also the animation for when carter is talking to someone is awkward, he's always crossing his arms and hitting his one arm with is hand.  that isn't a normal stance for anyone.

play it once, and then sell it because you'll never have a reason to pop the disk back in again.",2,game,game interest premise 1960s alien invasion come earth secret group xcom world last defense play main character william carter fun end third person shooter constantly go battle mode control two agent always every mission feel much long even minor mission rank fellow agent play really find like two agent skills other everyone rank max keep use two like deploy special ability annoy order place something move item walk around verse move something spot stupid pretty much every mission end back xcom base run around certain area talk certain npc may may open new mission also voice work really lame half time tell main guy shock mad jokingits voice also animation carter talk someone awkward always cross arm hit one arm hand normal stance anyone play sell never reason pop disk back
"i waited about a little over a week to do this review so i could be as accurate and honest as possible. i'll start with the short list & below that will be the full details if you care.

my stats:
27-weeks (6.5mos) -- started using at 25weeks
5'11""
pre-preg size: 8/10 (29) pants, sm dress, sm shirts
  pre-preg measurements: 36-26-39
maternity pants: i have (2) pair of hm size 12 skinny jeans that fit perfect
1st baby, all belly
size ordered: 2

pros:
- hides that my pre-preg pants are unbuttoned and/or unzipped
- good stretch to the material for a growing bump
- nice fold down option for the smaller bump
- smooth appearance under a shirt, even when folded
- doesn't roll if you pull it down to just below the belt loop

cons:
- strong chemical smell out of package
- ""chemical"" made me itch uncontrollably & feel nauseated
- after hand washing to release chemical the fit is not as good

details:
i finally purchased this item after a day a work where a coworker laughingly pointed out my that ""rubber band through the button & hole"" hack was no longer working because my zipper was no longer staying up, but she was impressed that even pregnant i was still wearing beautiful undies. lol!! **i'm not longer embarrassed because i've been naked in front of so many doctors & nurses throughout this high risk pregnancy that it doesn't even matter anymore.** anyway, i received the package direct from amazon in the igrid & isabel packaging & since i was about to head out i was excited to wear it right away because that meant i could wear my pre-preggo pants & would have a lot more outfit options. i opened the package & was greeted with a very strong chemical smell. i haven't had much sensitivity to smell, but asked for a 2nd opinion, my friend said it smelled like it came straight from a factory in china. i set it outside to air while i did my makeup and then got dressed. when i put it on, i didn't smell it much, and my initial impression was that it fit perfect. it was fitted all over, but there was clearly enough stretchable room to grow into. unfortunately after about 3-hours i was feeling nauseous, slightly dizzy, and my stomach & the skin touching the band was itching like crazy. it was definitely the chemicals from the bellaband. now, i've never had an irritation to any materials or chemicals in the fabrics. i wear anything from forever 21, h&m, guess, seven for all mankind, it doesn't matter as long as it fits & has a cute style. this was a problem! i got home & my stomach was red from all the scratching, but no visible skin irritation. i immediately put it in the sink with cool water to hand wash it (see photos), i expected to see black dye run out--as per usual with cheap clothes, but what i saw was shocking. the water turned yellow. like country time lemonde yellow. whatever chemical was it it was running out. i snapped a couple photos, then added laundry soap. to my surprise, no black dye ran out. only yellow. i did a number of washes & rinses until the water was virtually clear & no more yellow (probably 4 or 5 hand washes) and let it air dry. i wore it again 2days later and it didn't fit the same. the bottom has a clear maybe silicone/rubber ""banded line"" that grips the clothes & keeps a nice snug fit, however the top half that covers my upper belly is baggy now. even when folded the top half is a bit big. i know that i'll grow into it eventually, but i likely won't fit into my pre-preggo jeans once my belly gets that big, so it kind of defeats the purpose. i also took a photo in a fitted non-maternity tank top so you can see it does have some use. without the band, the top would otherwise roll up & and my unbuttoned pants would def be exposed. the lines under the shirt are all from the band bring folded & no longer ""fitted"" at the top.",1,fashion,wait little week review could accurate honest possible start short list & full detail care stats 27weeks 65mos start use 25weeks 511 prepreg size 810 29 pant sm dress sm shirt prepreg measurement 362639 maternity pant 2 pair hm size 12 skinny jean fit perfect 1st baby belly size orderetongue_sticking_out_cheeky_playful_or_blowing_a_raspberry 2 pro hide prepreg pant unbuttoned andor unzip good stretch material grow bump nice fold option small bump smooth appearance shirt even fold roll pull belt loop con strong chemical smell package chemical make itch uncontrollably & feel nauseated hand wash release chemical fit good detail finally purchase item day work coworker laughingly point rubber band button & hole hack longer work zipper longer stay impressed even pregnant still wear beautiful undies lol * * longer embarrass naked front many doctor & nurse throughout high risk pregnancy even matter anymore * * anyway receive package direct amazon igrid & isabel packaging & since head excite wear right away mean could wear prepreggo pant & would lot outfit option open package & greet strong chemical smell much sensitivity smell ask 2nd opinion friend say smell like come straight factory china set outside air makeup get dress put smell much initial impression fit perfect fit clearly enough stretchable room grow unfortunately 3hours feel nauseous slightly dizzy stomach & skin touching band itch like crazy definitely chemical bellaband never irritation material chemical fabric wear anything forever 21 h & guess seven mankind matter long fit & cute style problem get home & stomach red scratching visible skin irritation immediately put sink cool water hand wash see photo expect see black dye run outas per usual cheap clothes saw shock water turn yellow like country time lemonde yellow whatever chemical running snap couple photo add laundry soap surprise black dye run yellow number wash & rinse water virtually clear & yellow probably 4 5 hand wash let air dry wore 2days late fit bottom clear maybe siliconerubber banded line grip clothes & keep nice snug fit however top half cover upper belly baggy even fold top half bit big know grow eventually likely fit prepreggo jean belly get big kind defeat purpose also take photo fit nonmaternity tank top see use without band top would otherwise roll & unbuttoned pant would def exposed line shirt band bring fold & longer fit top

"my golf game ernie els----is fun to play.  but it is barely adequate in what it offers.  it is built on the same platform programming that tiger woods 08 used, with not nearly the number of golf courses.
in fact, if you did not have the graphics on the cover of the box you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this game and the old tiger woods.

with the number of courses available on the tiger woods 08 and probably a cheaper price, plus all the modded golf courses available for tiger woods 08, if it weren't for a portion of the monies going to a charity from the sale of the ernie els version, i would consider this a big disappointment.

"overall i would have to give this a 7 out of 10 rating. the interface is attractive and easy to use, and it seems very stable.
the amount of features that interrupt you constantly is annoying to say the least. the computer is always bugging you to sign in to this and that and generally irritating you each time you connect to the internet.
i wanted to know how to backup my system recently. well that was a mission in itself. i tried windows help - but that was useless. i tried microsoft's web site but that was a waste of time as well. i eventually found out how to load this feature after searching the net for 3 hours!!
as far as i am concerned the backup feature is one of the most important features in the operating system. im sure amny users will agree with this.
so why does microsoft feel it is necessary to hide this feature so deep in the cd rom installation disk? maybe they are trying to get users to but the more expensive ""pro"" edition when they eventually get tired of looking for this feature? i almost did.
for those who want to install this feature - here is the procedure. dont go to microsoft for help or you will be wasting your time.
  hidden deep in the recesses of the windows xp home edition cd lies the actual installation program that you need to put the backup utility on your computer.  simply insert the xp cd, and run ntbackup.msi (it might look like just ""ntbackup"") program from the folder d:\valueadd\msft\ntbackup where d: is the letter of your cd drive.  this will launch the windows backup utility installation wizard, which will install the utility automatically.  when it is finished, click ""finish.""",1,software,overall would give 7 10 rating interface attractive easy use seem stable amount feature interrupt constantly annoy say least computer always bug sign generally irritating time connect internet want know backup system recently well mission try window help useless tried microsoft web site waste time well eventually find load feature search net 3 hour far concerned backup feature one important feature operate system im sure amny user agree microsoft feel necessary hide feature deep cd rom installation disk maybe try get user expensive pro edition eventually get tired look feature almost want install feature procedure dont go microsoft help wasting time hidden deep recess windows xp home edition cd lie actual installation program need put backup utility computer simply insert xp cd run ntbackupmsi might look like ntbackup program folder tongue_sticking_out_cheeky_playful_or_blowing_a_raspberry\valueadd\msft\ntbackup tongue_sticking_out_cheeky_playful_or_blowing_a_raspberry letter cd drive launch windows backup utility installation wizard install utility automatically finish click finish

2.) when playing, i found it difficult to remember what i had just played, because i was too focused on looking from tv to guitar, tv to guitar, etc. to make sure i was playing the right notes.  i found that when i would replay the song, it was like playing for the first time, because seeing the notes was more of a fleeting glimpse than something i could commit to memory.

"first, i must clarify that i am currently in the midst of using this program. i am just now finishing up level 2 out of 3.

second, i also own rosetta stone v2 - german level 1. by throwing myself into german culture--listening to music, looking up translations, reading a book here and there, having a friend speak fluent german--i still know more german than spanish. it's the language i'm most passionate about because that's where my distant family is from. working in retail, is it practical in arizona? no.

so i have begun going full throttle with learning to speak fluent spanish. i can't imagine the enthusiasm i will have when i can easily answer questions from a spanish speaking customer. finishing level 2, do i feel at all comfortable dealing with spanish guests? no. beyond saying ""necesitas ayuda?"" and telling them to hold on one moment while i get a native who works at the store--i'm helpless. i focus on this program, and i understand almost every term taught to me; anything i don't understand, i find a translation and review the lesson.

three can't inform me much more, especially considering the fact that level 2 contained shopping/retail situations.

i am not disappointed with rosetta stone, however. i don't have the confidence to easily speak, but i feel that day is approaching. it won't begin with the end of finishing level three, however. immersing yourself into everything spanish is a must. combine this was some vocabulary cards (or use open source mnemosyne), read a book, youtube some spanish shows, find some children's spanish books, etc. learning a language seems less about taking steps up, but rather filling your ""pond"" of knowledge. rosetta stone contributes quite a bit of water, but it alone cannot come close to filling the pond.",1,software,first must clarify currently midst use program finishing level 2 3 second also rosetta stone v2 german level 1 throwing german culturelistening music look translation read book friend speak fluent germani still know german spanish language passionate distant family work retail practical arizona begin go full throttle learn speak fluent spanish imagine enthusiasm easily answer question spanish speak customer finish level 2 feel comfortable deal spanish guest beyond say necesitas ayuda tell hold one moment get native work storei helpless focus program understand almost every term teach anything understand find translation review lesson three inform much especially consider fact level 2 contain shoppingretail situation disappoint rosetta stone however confidence easily speak feel day approach begin end finish level three however immerse everything spanish must combine vocabulary card use open source mnemosyne read book youtube spanish show find child spanish book etc learn language seem less take step rather fill pond knowledge rosetta stone contribute quite bit water alone come close filling pond

"snow leopard gave my unibody mac a significant boost in performance, especially during large processing tasks that run opencl. while the boost isn't completely unexpected, i honestly wasn't expecting quite this much of an increase over leopard.

being able to browse through stacks is quite nice. while i didn't really think this was a significant improvement at first, i've noticed i'm using stacks more now than i did in leopard, now that i don't have to jump to a finder window so often.

quicktime x offers some speed improvements over quicktime in some areas, but currently doesn't work with the perian codec package. fortunately, the programmers who contribute to perian are aware of this and are working on a solution. vlc media player works great, and i've always used it to supplement quicktime, so it isn't a big deal for me. if one installs quicktime 7 from the optional installs (and there is another work around, if i'm not mistaken), one can still view codecs via perian in quicktime.

at around $30, it's the cheapest non-free os you'll ever get your hands on, and a performance-loaded one at that. parallel processing is the way to go, as evidenced by the emergence of opencl, cuda, and the like.

at first neooffice 3.0 didn't work for me, bouncing in the dock but refusing to launch. a patch update was issued on the neooffice website rather quickly and everything works great now. all of my applications (all additional ones of which are free and/or open source) work just fine.",0,software,snow leopard give unibody mac significant boost performance especially large process task run opencl boost completely unexpected honestly expect quite much increase leopard able browse stack quite nice really think significant improvement first notice use stack leopard jump finder window often quicktime x offer speed improvement quicktime area currently work perian codec package fortunately programmer contribute perian aware work solution vlc medium player work great always use supplement quicktime big deal one install quicktime 7 optional installs another work around mistake one still view codecs via perian quicktime around $ 30 cheap nonfree o ever get hand performanceloaded one parallel processing way go evidenced emergence opencl cuda like first neooffice 30 work bounce dock refuse launch patch update issue neooffice website rather quickly everything work great application additional one free andor open source work fine

beware of the talkback cable, which connects the headset to the xbox, it fails

i got my turtle beach, x42 headset for christmas, 2014. it is aug.,2015 and my cable just died. i could hear no one talking during the game. the sound of the game was coming through with no problem, it was just that i could not communicate, or hear anyone communicating. i think that it is actually not the cable, but the controller part for listening/talking to people. i just ordered three of these puppies, for pickup at my local walmart, for $9.95 each. they are the turtle beach cables, not a knock-off/generic. i don't want to take any chances for the future, as turtle beach is currently out-of-stock on the cables. there are way too many people that have had their cable die on them. i have to believe that this is a bad design, which turtle beach should have corrected, long ago. they have a good headset and strap this cheapo/defective cable to it--why? it would seem that turtle beach is not interested in product quality, only product sales. for all of the people that have given a lot of stars to this product, i have to wonder if they are reacting to the replacement solely from its' arrival and first use. what happens after that? many have stated that it starts off o.k., and then essentially stops working, just like the original cable. this essentially means that you have to keep a stock pile of cables handy, as you know that the cable is going to fail at some point. turtle beach is making money off the cables, by having a defective product, which people have to get, if they want to continue using their headsets. i currently would tell folks to look for a better quality headset, and not purchase the turtle beach ones, unless you don't mind continually replacing the cable. depending on how often you had to replace the cable, this cost could add up.",0,game,xbox 360 e & 360 owner must purchase adapter use great headset headset require optical connection neither 360 e 360 model headset work without audio converteradapter xbox model luckily one sale amazon buy sale right 122614 viewhd premium hdmi hdmi + audio spdif + rac lr audio extractor | converter | vhdh2hsas addendum august 15 2015 beware talkback cable connects headset xbox fails get turtle beach x42 headset christmas 2014 aug2015 cable die could hear one talk game sound game come problem could communicate hear anyone communicate think actually cable controller part listeningtalking people order three puppy pickup local walmart $ 995 turtle beach cable knockoffgeneric want take chance future turtle beach currently outofstock cable way many people cable die believe bad design turtle beach correct long ago good headset strap cheapodefective cable itwhy would seem turtle beach interested product quality product sale people give lot star product wonder react replacement solely arrival first use happen many state start ok essentially stop work like original cable essentially mean keep stock pile cable handy know cable go fail point turtle beach make money cable defective product people get want continue use headset currently would tell folk look good quality headset purchase turtle beach one unless mind continually replace cable depend often replace cable cost could add

this game..is just......omg so hard....the first main level is one of the dungeons which is seriously too hard to beat w/ out 1. stressing ur self or 2. look at walk throughs online. although later stages gets easier, or u just kinda get a hang of what type of things they are looking for but for begginers that never played zelda on other console this isn't a great game to start with.

graphics: 3/5 seriously after looking at gow ...i can't see a game that beat it yet....differnt consoles..but still...but w/ in the same console it will be one of the better graphic games

glitch: not a lot except ur remote sometimes dun act the way u want...

game play: fun but frustrating...wuts the deal w/ not being able to jump in the game...seiously...u either roll forward or jump back wards..can't jump forward..but other things are fine

"several reviews on this site and on a couple game review sites led me to believe this game was fun.
it is not.
the creators do an excellent job of simulating real war.
you as one soldier have only a very small impact on the results of each scenario in the campaign.
most firefights are at the range at which, even ""zoomed in"", you can't really see your opponent, so much as the flash from his gun.
you can't aim your gun with accurate crosshairs as in all other computer shooters.  instead you get a vague bar that gives you a basic idea where your bullets might land.
there's a lot of down time between battles.  a lot.  and you must sit through every excruciating second of it.
usually, when you get hit, you have no idea where the bullet came from, and, of course, you are dead.
and, finally, you only get two chances.  you can save each multi-battle scenario in the campaign once.  don't squander it, or you'll have to ride in the truck for 5 minutes again.
all of these factors serve to make the game a very realistic rendition of real war.  and they also make it a miserable, bewildering, and boring experience.
gameplay issues aside, the so-called ""codemasters"" are no such thing; there are many bugs that have entirely halted my progress through the game.  it's going in the stack of old, sorry games i will never play again.
and don't be fooled by the demo;  amazingly enough, it is not representative of the actual gameplay.",2,game,several review site couple game review sit lead believe game fun creator excellent job simulate real war one soldier small impact result scenario campaign firefights range even zoom really see opponent much flash gun aim gun accurate crosshairs computer shooter instead get vague bar give basic idea bullet might land lot time battle lot must sit every excruciate second usually get hit idea bullet come course dead finally get two chance save multibattle scenario campaign squander ride truck 5 minute factor serve make game realistic rendition real war also make miserable bewilder boring experience gameplay issue aside socalled codemasters thing many bug entirely halt progress game go stack old sorry game never play fool demo amazingly enough representative actual gameplay

"first and foremost, this is labeled as a ""complete comic book collection"".  it's not.  ultimate x-men ran 100 issues and ended in 2010.  this was made in 2006 when only 69 issues were available and the arc was ongoing.  the first annual is included in here, but not the others.

that said, it's really a cool thing to have.  the scans are excellent quality, with the left and right pages visible on each scan.  it's perfect for the two-page spreads and the unconventional panel layout.  i've got no complaints about scrolling through it.  i love the feel of the original books, but i didn't mind reading it digitally.

the original ads are preserved, right as they were in the original comics.  it's kind of a neat little trip through memory lane, but i can see how people don't like that.  there are a few points where the issue that was scanned had some printing errors, but that'd happen if you were collecting the originals.  for the most part, the comics scanned were in great shape and the resolution allows you to really zoom in.

"i have been using quicken since 1991.  today i spent 2 hours reading through all the amazon reviews, picked out the ones that gave me constructive information outlining special steps to take to achieve a successful installation of 2016 premier. all went well with the installation -- no problems with the intuit account and password since i set that up prior to the install (as was recommended by one reviewer).  after the install, i compared the account balances i had printed off from my 2013 version to the balances on the new 2016 version and all matched perfectly.  i thought i was home free and had triumphed. not so fast, i then performed an update for my stock accounts . . . that's what initiated my tailspin taking me all the way down to serial primal screaming fits.  2016 'removed' quite a number of securities (it took me over an hour to just figure out what had happened because all the totals no longer matched). i was feeling ok at that point because i knew i could simply go into each of those individual stock accounts and delete the actions that 'removed' each security.  wishful (or naive) thinking, because there is nothing to delete.  i hope i can describe this so it's understandable.  when i enter the security name in the 'search' box, it comes up in a new pop-up window with all the transactions over the last 20 years i have owned this particular stock.  on today's date, there is a single grayed out entry that states 'removed'.  but there is an active hyperlink for today's date and when hovering over it, it tells me that by clicking on the link, it will take me to the transaction so i can edit it.  great!!  when i click on it, it takes me to that account alright, but unfortunately there is nothing there for today's date. nothing that can be deleted or edited.  when i scroll back through 20 years of data in the account, the reinvested dividends are all there.  however, the stock has been deleted from the account total.  i can't even imagine how this could be.  they are all there, but none are accounted for in total.  for this one investment account, i have 6 stocks -- and 3 have been arbitrarily 'removed' and i don't see any method of getting the program to recognize them.  i have now uninstalled 2016 and restored my last backed up file to 2013.  yes, i followed the advice of one of the reviewers here on how to install 2016 without over-writing 2013 (plus i have the original discs in my file drawer).  we have the faa to investigate plane crashes, the nhtsa to investigate defective car components and enforce recalls at the manufacturer's expense.  what agency has the responsibility for oversight of defective software products?  why isn't intuit (or quicken's new owner) required to fix the product correctly and in a timely manner -- or face stiff government fines and penalties.  especially given the fact that quicken is now pretty much a monopoly.  i think we need to bring judge greene back from his grave to break up this monopoly (al a at&t).",2,software,use quicken since 1991 today spend 2 hour read amazon review pick one give constructive information outline special step take achieve successful installation 2016 premier go well installation problem intuit account password since set prior install recommend one reviewer install compare account balance print 2013 version balance new 2016 version match perfectly think home free triumph fast performed update stock account initiate tailspin take way serial primal scream fit 2016 aremoved quite number security take hour figure happen total longer match feel ok point knew could simply go individual stock account delete action aremoved security wishful naive thinking nothing delete hope describe understandable enter security name isearch box come new popup window transaction last 20 year own particular stock today date single grayed entry state aremoved active hyperlink today date hovering tell click link take transaction edit great click take account alright unfortunately nothing today date nothing delete edit scroll back 20 year data account reinvested dividend however stock delete account total even imagine could none account total one investment account 6 stock 3 arbitrarily aremoved see method get program recognize uninstalled 2016 restore last back file 2013 yes follow advice one reviewers install 2016 without overwrite 2013 plus original disc file drawer faa investigate plane crash nhtsa investigate defective car component enforce recall manufacturer expense agency responsibility oversight defective software product intuit quicken new owner require fix product correctly timely manner face stiff government fine penalty especially give fact quicken pretty much monopoly think need bring judge greene back grave break monopoly al &

the second problem seems to me to be a very easy fix. if the user is transferring the new spreadsheet into excel it transfers each page into a different sheet. i really wish that i could turn this off and send each page into one sheet. i have 242 pages of documents that need to be anaylized as one set of numbers. having to paste each page into one sheet is really very tiresome.",1,software,purchase omnipage abbyy difference two impressive omnipage really read document well abbyy accuracy spreadsheet view fantastic smart enough recognize row columns different page page however two dissapointing aspect product first recognition horizontal vertical line miss user must go individual page correct miss omnipage far few miss abbyy work 242page document try transform pdf file excel analysis data pdf go page find problem annoy time consume least second problem seem easy fix user transfer new spreadsheet excel transfer page different sheet really wish could turn send page one sheet 242 page document need anaylized one set number paste page one sheet really tiresome

surroundings on screen.  again other games have solved this, so not sure why this one keeps you a mile away looking down on your character
in order to be able to play with a reasonable amount of perspective.

there is no good or bad in this game,and if you stand and fight is for the good of your goverment,this region has a very strategical importance for all 3 star empires,first we must know that these anomalies appeared in the neutral zone,m-class planets,new races,and the rich dilithium planets that are far richer than a ordinary dilithium planet are the reasons of its importance,of course all the goverments are on the rush to have these systems,the federation and romulan star empire,look at this situation as a oppertunity to uphold their strength,but due to the loss of praxis(klingon moon)the klingons look at the sitiuation as a golden oppertunity to escape the peace treaty
that is going to be negotiated with the federation,and uphold the honor and strength of their empire,

"the first couple of months you own this game (eq) its like the world has  stopped.  you check online sites like everlore.com and eqvault.com for  additional information. you run around killing creatures, going on quests,  talking with other characters.  man, everything is great in the world  (everquest world, that is.  the real world is just a distant memory).  and  i have to be honest, at first i thought this was the greatest gaming  experience out there.  the world seemed endless and full of potential.  i  wanted to try out different characters and races and journey to all  three/four of the continents.  how cool is it to be a barbarian shaman with  the ability to cast spells and to fight, or to be a dark elf necromancer  running around in toxx forest.  there are both non-pvp (where players can't  kill each other unless both characters consent to a duel or they enter an  arena) and pvp servers (where, depending on the server, you can kill other  characters within a certain level of your character, or only characters of  a particular race--there is supposed to be a race war on one of the pvp  servers). (i recommend the pvp servers for more hard core roleplaying,  although as i later discuss, there isn't as much in this game as i hoped).  ahh, evercrack (as its affectionately known) was my life.
and then, all  the ""little"" problems caught up with me and the game began to  annoy to no end.  the list became too numerous:  lack of real roleplaying  by the participants, horrible lag problems for non top-of-the-line  computers, loading of zones that take seemingly forever (in eq, the land is  divided into zones, and when you go from one zone to another, the game  takes a while to load the zone onto your computer;  one city, freeport, has  three zones! ugh!), the fact that many of the really neat creatures or  places or items are ""camped"" to death (which means that you have  to wait your turn--believe, that can take forever), the ""newbie""  areas suffer from overcrowding.
basically, the game became a huge time  suck.  even relatively minor actions take a very very long time.  eq is  definitely not a game to be played in short blocks of time. counting load  times, and the time necessary to recover your body and items, the average  session was about 3 hours minimum. and then come the experience penalites.  after a certain level, when you die, you lose a certain percentage of your  experience.  in other words, i spent three hours gaining a  ""bubble"" of experience (you need five, if i remember correctly,  to get to the next level) and then lost that bubble when i was killed by a  mammoth in everfrost.  well, guess i blew those three hours.
one of the  strengths of eq, especially when compared with asheron's call, is the  interaction with other players.  essentially, the game is like a chat room  with graphics.  which is cool when you become ""friends"" (in an  internet sense) with other in-game characters.
however, this strength  can also drive you nuts after a while, especially when you get into a zone  and people are completely out of character and shouting nonsense to each  other.  made me feel like i was back in high school, sometimes.
also,  don't confuse this game with a roleplaying experience.  after a few months,  the pattern of the game falls into:  go out, join a group (which is  necessary because some creatures can't be killed one-on-one), camp a  monster or an area, hack and slash, repeat.  there are plenty of quests,  but most of them still focus on going out and killing something.
hey,  its hard for me to review this game because i thought it was the greatest  thing since sliced bread for about 4-5 months. and then, things turned  sour.  not all at once, but gradually.  hey, fans of eq are fanatical (i  was one of them once) and they have reason:  eq is addictive and can be a  lot of fun.  but, i am reviewing this game after having played it for  almost a year.  it starts off wonderful, but then it becomes more of a  pain.  so, i give it 5 stars to start, then 2 stars for the last couple of  months i played it.  overall:  3 stars.",1,game,first couple month game eq like world stop check online site like everlorecom eqvaultcom additional information run around kill creature go quest talk character man everything great world everquest world real world distant memory honest first think great game experience world seem endless full potential want try different character race journey threefour continent cool barbarian shaman ability cast spell fight dark elf necromancer run around toxx forest nonpvp player kill unless character consent duel enter arena pvp server depend server kill character within certain level character character particular racethere suppose race war one pvp server recommend pvp server hard core roleplay although later discuss much game hop ahh evercrack affectionately know life little problem catch game begin annoy end list become numerous lack real roleplaying participant horrible lag problem non topoftheline computer load zone take seemingly forever eq land divide zone go one zone another game take load zone onto computer one city freeport three zone ugh fact many really neat creature place item camp death mean wait turnbelieve take forever newbie area suffer overcrowd basically game become huge time suck even relatively minor action take long time eq definitely game play short block time count load time time necessary recover body item average session 3 hour minimum come experience penalites certain level die lose certain percentage experience word spend three hour gain bubble experience need five remember correctly get next level lose bubble kill mammoth everfrost well guess blow three hour one strengths eq especially compare asheron call interaction player essentially game like chat room graphic cool become friend internet sense ingame character however strength also drive nut especially get zone people completely character shout nonsense make feel like back high school sometimes also confuse game roleplay experience month pattern game fall go join group necessary creature kill oneonone camp monster area hack slash repeat plenty quest still focus go kill something hey hard review game think great thing since slice bread 45 month thing turn sour gradually hey fan eq fanatical one reason eq addictive lot fun review game play almost year start wonderful becomes pain give 5 star start 2 star last couple month play overall 3 star

"@the ""software expert""...

i grant you that microsoft has more than their fair share of ""vulnerabilities"" to deal with and their track record of addressing said ""vulnerabilities"" may be somewhat questionable.  with that said, imho, i think it is important to recognize and commend their efforts to develop a product such as windows live onecare, regardless of past transgressions, real or perceived...

i decided to post this comment based on your ""honest review"" and recommendation to ""stick with symantec products"".  frankly, i have to disagree with you based on what you wrote.  symantec has long been recognized as a leader in the field of third-party os utilities, but, imho, this recognition is thoroughly unjustified, especially given the abominable performance of their utilities and the seriously detrimental effects subsequently placed on the host system's resources and performance...

i do not know your qualifications as a ""software expert"", but if you are in fact what you say you are, you should take a little more time to try and reach an objective perspective before firing off a condemnation of one product in favor of another without providing any conclusive evidence to support your position.  if you want people to actually pay attention to your reviews, you should think about balancing your subjectivity out with a fact or two that brought you to your strongly held opinion...

for those that may actually read this, i think it is important to disclose a couple of things at this point:

1. i am not an employee of microsoft, symantec or any other potentially related entity

2. i am not being compensated for my review here by microsoft, symantec or any other potentially related entity

3. i have not installed microsoft windows live onecare 1.0, beta or otherwise, on any pc currently in my possession, or for any business client for that matter, and as such i will not profess any expertise whatsoever with regard to the capabilities contained within microsoft windows live onecare 1.0

4. i have given microsoft windows live onecare 1.0 a rating of three stars only because the rating is required by amazon in order to post this comment.

i would advise any reader of this comment to seek a wide variety of opinions, both expert and non-expert, before making any purchase decision of this nature.  all the best with your final purchase decision...",1,software,@ software expert grant microsoft fair share vulnerability deal track record addressing say vulnerability may somewhat questionable say imho think important recognize commend effort develop product window live onecare regardless past transgression real perceive decide post comment base honest review recommendation stick symantec product frankly disagree base write symantec long recognize leader field thirdparty os utility imho recognition thoroughly unjustified especially give abominable performance utility seriously detrimental effect subsequently place host system resource performance know qualification software expert fact say take little time try reach objective perspective fire condemnation one product favor another without provide conclusive evidence support position want people actually pay attention review think balance subjectivity fact two bring strongly hold opinion may actually read think important disclose couple thing point 1 employee microsoft symantec potentially related entity 2 compensate review microsoft symantec potentially related entity 3 installed microsoft window live onecare 10 beta otherwise pc currently possession business client matter profess expertise whatsoever regard capability contain within microsoft window live onecare 10 4 give microsoft window live onecare 10 rating three star rating require amazon order post comment would advise reader comment seek wide variety opinion expert nonexpert make purchase decision nature best final purchase decision
"i have to admit that it makes me nervous to read of all the reviewers who may have found errors in the program. even worse, though, is that lack of response from hr block.

however, the federal program did work well for me. i complete my taxes and my sister and her husband's taxes using this program, and it does a good job interviewing you to find the various deductions, credits and so on. i have a side business, and the computer correctly explains how to deduct the various business expenses i encounter. she has two children, and their expenses are itemized. the computer correctly found the expenses she should itemize.

when you move on to the state returns for minnesota and pennsylvania, it's easy to see that the program quality takes a big step down. the interviews are not as thorough, and when the going gets tough, the program refers you to the form to do your own work. this is interesting because the state forms are simpler than the federal forms, so they should be more smooth, not less smooth.

there's a lot of great elements to this game, the best thing about this game that it encourages team work. there are actual benefits with every class of soldier and the maps always put you in situations where it is beneficial to share vehicles. anyone who has played bf1942 knows that there's almost no benefit to sharing most vehicles. this time around you don't have to completely rely on your ability to kill to become a valuable team member so this is great if you are new. you can supply ammo and first aid to your team members among other things.

however there are some vehicle issues that really bug me. i have always loved to fly planes in bf1942 but with the jets in this game i was very disappointed to find only 1 or 2 on a map (on a server of 64 people even). i was soon to discover why. the jets are extremely powerful, and there literally is no way to take out a jet unless you have a jet of your own. this is where the problem starts, the enemy jets know where your runway is and they typically swoop near by until the next pilot takes off and boom, you don't even get a chance to take off or you barely got into the air. i'm just amazed that nothing even stands a chance against a jet! it's not surprising that there are so many infantry only servers, it feels pretty cheap to be bombed by a jet 10 times in a row. when you actually get in the jet don't expect an epic dog fight either, it's a case of who sees who first and you shoot when you see the blinking light that says shoot. it's not very satisfying on either end of the missile.

for someone who loved to fly the planes so much in bf1942 this was a big disappointment but the helicopters make up for it somewhat and thankfully they aren't indestructible.

the other thing which really bugs me was the choice of armies, okay america and china makes sense but what the hell is the ""middle east coalition""? and what the hell is the ""european army""? oh and whats up with every single map having america as one of the teams but no map is ever situated in america? it feels like america just went crazy and tried taking over the world. but don't buy this game for the plot obviously, i just thought that was odd.

to summarize it's a great game but maps with to much jet power can ruin the experience. i think i will play this for a while but probably drift back to 1942, i hope they remake 1942 with a similar engine some day as it would make a perfect game for me.",1,game,play bf 1942 long time quite content one favorite game play online even never try one simply computer little outdated decide grab copy recently bring new computer lot great element game best thing game encourage team work actual benefit every class soldier map always put situation beneficial share vehicle anyone play bf1942 know almost benefit share vehicle time around completely rely ability kill become valuable team member great new supply ammo first aid team member among thing however vehicle issue really bug always love fly plane bf1942 jet game disappoint find 1 2 map server 64 people even soon discover jet extremely powerful literally way take jet unless jet problem start enemy jet know runway typically swoop near next pilot take boom even get chance take barely get air amaze nothing even stand chance jet surprise many infantry server feel pretty cheap bomb jet 10 time row actually get jet expect epic dog fight either case see first shoot see blink light say shoot satisfy either end missile someone love fly plane much bf1942 big disappointment helicopter make somewhat thankfully indestructible thing really bugs choice army okay america china make sense hell middle east coalition hell european army oh whats every single map america one team map ever situate america feel like america go crazy try take world buy game plot obviously think odd summarize great game map much jet power ruin experience think play probably drift back 1942 hope remake 1942 similar engine day would make perfect game

"when i was a kid, my brother and i used to head to our local supermarket just to play street smart. they had a cabinet set up near the cash registers, and we used to spend a fortune playing the game in co-op mode. it was so innovative for the time, a fighting game that was 2 on 2 simultaneously; and the losers get hauled off in an ambulance.

this little unknown game was developed by snk, and had a very limited run. it was almost pointless going up against all the street fighter hype, but this game was a blast. anyone who spent a quarter or 2 on it can attest to that.

well, later rather than sooner, it hit the home console. you can bet we were enthralled. we picked it up on day one for the genesis, and were psyched. the shrink wrap gets torn asunder, cart savagely jammed into the model 1 genesis. then we realized something.

this version doesn't have co-op.

that was the entire draw of the original coin-op! how could they do this?

well, it was 2 players, but you had to take turns fighting. that's right. why even bother? that's like bringing an arcade racer to console and forgetting to program the track you drive on. still, we made the best of it.

(growl later satiated our blood lust for 2 player simultaneous action. well, the arcade version anyway. the genesis version was single player.)

the game itself played a bit smoother than its arcade counterpart. the graphics also seemed a bit more bright and colorful, and the music ""pops"" a bit more. there were a couple extra fights added, and a new versus mode as well. the ridiculous difficulty of the original was watered down a tad, making for a more enjoyable and rounded experience.

sure, the lack of street smart's infamous 2 player mode is jarring, but once you start to play it you'll forget all about it. it's a unique title, one worth checking out. give it a fair shot; you won't be sorry.

at least you can still put your opponent in an ambulance. oh wait; no you can't.",1,game,kid brother use head local supermarket play street smart cabinet set near cash register use spend fortune playing game coop mode innovative time fight game 2 2 simultaneously loser get haul ambulance little unknown game develop snk limited run almost pointless go street fighter hype game blast anyone spent quarter 2 attest well later rather sooner hit home console bet enthral pick day one genesis psyched shrink wrap get torn asunder cart savagely jam model 1 genesis realize something version coop entire draw original coinop could well 2 player take turn fight right even bother like bring arcade racer console forget program track drive still make best growl later satiate blood lust 2 player simultaneous action well arcade version anyway genesis version single player game play bit smooth arcade counterpart graphic also seem bit bright colorful music pop bit couple extra fight add new versus mode well ridiculous difficulty original watered tad make enjoyable rounded experience sure lack street smart infamous 2 player mode jar start play forget unique title one worth check give fair shot sorry least still put opponent ambulance oh wait
"sadly, most of the bad reviews (written by critical thinkers) that you're seeing here for simcity 4 are accurate. i've been a simcity fan ever since its earliest versions back in the early 90's. after mastering each version, i always look forward to what great new innovations the maxis folks can come up with next. there are some excellent new features to simcity 4, of course. the buildings look more futuristic and realistic, the disasters are cooler, and the ability to tie multiple cities into a regional entity is a real plus. the biggest improvement is with landscaping. in the ""terraforming"" mode you are able to create remarkable mountains and valleys, cliffs and canyons, resulting in eye-catching landscapes that the sims can build upon in architecturally intriguing ways.
that's the end of the favorable portion of my review. see the other reviews here for the never-ending list of programming glitches that bog down this game. here are some problems i've been having. the ""rotate"" buttons work in the wrong directions, when you are told to dispatch firemen or police to a disaster area you can't see where the disaster is, and residential units that are right next to the street say they don't have road access. one enhancement that i do not like is the automatic streets that appear when you lay down large zoning areas. these result in a messy traffic pattern with streets that may not even be connected to others, and then you have to remove zoned areas that you just spent money building. and finally there is the response time and program performance. sure i don't have the most powerful computer in the world, but it's among the better models that regular consumers can get in the home computer market. that makes me part of the typical simcity audience, so a game that doesn't freeze up my computer on a regular basis shouldn't be too much to ask for. plus the installation took twenty minutes and three restarts.
whoever made the decision at maxis/ea to release this game in its current state made a really bad management decision. there are so many programming glitches that this product should not be in the hands of the public. other folks here have suggested that you wait until a repaired or updated version of simcity 4 is released. i don't disagree with them.",1,game,sadly bad review write critical thinker see simcity 4 accurate simcity fan ever since early version back early 90 master version always look forward great new innovation maxis folk come next excellent new feature simcity 4 course building look futuristic realistic disaster cooler ability tie multiple city regional entity real plus big improvement landscape terraforming mode able create remarkable mountain valley cliffs canyon result eyecatching landscape sims build upon architecturally intrigue way end favorable portion review see review neverending list program glitch bog game problem rotate button work wrong direction tell dispatch fireman police disaster area see disaster residential unit right next street say road access one enhancement like automatic street appear lay large zone area result messy traffic pattern street may even connect other remove zone area spend money build finally response time program performance sure powerful computer world among good model regular consumer get home computer market make part typical simcity audience game freeze computer regular basis much ask plus installation take twenty minute three restarts whoever make decision maxisea release game current state make really bad management decision many programming glitch product hand public folk suggest wait repair updated version simcity 4 release disagree

i have 1.5 gigs and it was rediculously slow. i am still in the process of uninstalling it now and its taken over 10 minutes and it's not done yet. unless you have a lot of patience i would not fool with this one. maybe faster machines work fine with this but i would think since i had more than the minimum ram, it should have worked smoothly for me. i can only imagine how long it would have taken to edit something with this thing, if it took that long just to get the videos loaded into the interface.",2,software,high hope product really let downloaded trial version suggest other buy thing take 45 minute download trial equally long install installed tried find videos harddrive make dvd spend 20 minute try get videos system thing run slow take forever load video fool around try get videos load 30 minute give uninstalled trial version say system requirement need 1 gig ram minimum 2+ suggest 15 gig rediculously slow still process uninstalling take 10 minute do yet unless lot patience would fool one maybe faster machine work fine would think since minimum ram work smoothly imagine long would take edit something thing take long get video load interface

"i've used norton products (symantic) for well over a decade.  it does a good job of protecting your computer but when your subscription runs out you might as well go out and buy a complete new software package.  what they offer to continue your subcription is just as costly as a new software package and a new software package comes usally with three installs plus any new software updates.  when you renew your software you just get a costly one computer yearly update.  i have grow tired of norton's lack of treating folks that have purchased things from them with no loyality factor..ie give the folks that have purchased your software a decent discount for continued service.  i can come here or other places and get a newer version of the software cheaper than a continued update plan.  so norton is going away with me after many years and i getting on the zone alarm band wagon which offers one heck of a internet package for about the cost of norton antivirus.  so i give norton three stars only because the product did protect me from getting any virus's but the support of the product sucks!!!  i could write more nightmare stories on nortons tech support, some that costs you $$$ beyond what they consider normal support if you ever get in a virus bind.  the incident cost they levy....lets say this...unless you have kfc's original recipie on your hard drive, it would be cheaper to buy a new hard drive and software package then pay norton to help you remove your infection.  i guess they have to charge folks so much for the support or they would be on the phone 24-7 dealing with yahoo's that have infected their computers and are looking for norton to get them out of their mistakes (after the fact) ie...they buy the anti-virus software after the infection and find they have to do alot of additional manual file removal that the antivirus software can not handle.  that said i still feel symantic (norton) is a company that has gotten too big for their pants and has taken the consumer for granted unfortunately.  but this is my opinion.  other may feel differently but i'm not giving them anymore of my money until they start treating folks that have puchased there products better than a first time buyer.  one last thing, every rebate i have done with this company has been something you have to fight for.  one rebate took me a year to get and thank god i keep copies and good records because they will do what they can to get out of the rebates they offer.  you better do the rebate perfect to the letter and keep proof that you did!",1,software,use norton product symantic well decade good job protect computer subscription run might well go buy complete new software package offer continue subcription costly new software package new software package come usally three installs plus new software update renew software get costly one computer yearly update grow tire norton lack treat folk purchase thing loyal factorie give folk purchase software decent discount continue service come place get new version software cheap continue update plan norton go away many year get zone alarm band wagon offer one heck internet package cost norton antivirus give norton three star product protect get virus support product suck could write nightmare story nortons tech support cost $ $ $ beyond consider normal support ever get virus bind incident cost levylets say thisunless kfc original recipie hard drive would cheaper buy new hard drive software package pay norton help remove infection guess charge folk much support would phone 247 deal yahoo infect computer look norton get mistake fact iethey buy antivirus software infection find alot additional manual file removal antivirus software handle say still feel symantic norton company gotten big pant take consumer grant unfortunately opinion may feel differently give anymore money start treat folk puchased product well first time buyer one last thing every rebate do company something fight one rebate take year get thank god keep copy good record get rebate offer good rebate perfect letter keep proof

"based upon all the marketing that rosetta stone does you would think that their software was really novel and far superior to other language learning methods, but after some time with the software i am not so sure.  the software starts by having the user presented with various pictures and the software speaks the words for you for the phrases that you are practicing that particular unit.  at no point even in the ""grammar"" sessions is the concept of even basic word order ever even presented.  they basically presume that one is going to learn by trial and error, which given enough time will work, but without some basic understanding of grammar one is mindlessly repeating phrases until one discovers a pattern, which isn't exactly the most efficient means of learning.  while that is obviously the *only* way people learn an l1 language (ie. your first language, mother tongue, etc.) with l2 language learning it is sometimes helpful in cases where grammar of the language that one is learning is substantially different from one's native language to have some direct instruction on grammar sense without knowing grammar you can't really understand or use the language.  since mandarin chinese isn't even in the same general language group it isn't too surprising that the grammar rules are a bit different than english and hence even a little background might be helpful.

  a few other criticisms that i see are that such obviously useful concepts such as cardinal numbers don't get presented early.  in most language courses i'm familiar with such concepts get introduced fairly early.  one thing that gets a bit monotonous is that there isn't much variety whereas voices.  as far as i can tell there are two female voices and two male voices that simply get shuffled around.  another criticism i notice is the lack of authentic texts.  in the traditional courses i've taken for a foreign language there has always been various authentic real world uses of the language in question (eg. newspapers, advertisements, cartoons, etc.) that are used in exercises.  despite the cost of the program so far as i can tell rosetta stone didn't bother to license the use of any actual authentic content.  obviously licensing content costs money, but it seems exceedingly lazy to not even try to spend the time to make up some content.  if one were learning a language via immersion in a country where said language was the primary language one obviously would obviously see the language all around them in various non-contrived uses.  therefore, rosetta stone's boast of immersion seems to be a bit of marketing hype in my opinion.  heck, they don't even seem to teach anything about culture.  in the absence of understanding a bit of the culture one misses out on certain cultural references or phrases that would be useful in conversations.

  based upon the sample phrases i believe that i figured out a lot, but i ironically found ""cheating"" and looking up the definitions to a couple of the words in the canned phrases helpful insofar as that i wasn't guessing wrong repeatedly from the context of the sentence.  the marketing claims that one can build confidence to use one's vocabulary in real situations, but i don't see any opportunity to actually create one's own sentences and have the software grade your grammar.  as anyone who has ever used a grammar checker in microsoft word or similar application knows designing one that has perfect comprehension of grammatical rules can be difficult so expecting software to be able to grade your mini essays in a language that you are learning may be a bit of a tall order.  this is one area that would find in a traditional classroom environment that doesn't really get duplicated well in this software.  the ""writing"" sections are little more than picking 2-3 options.  to make matters worse often times the answers are basically verbatim of what one had seen in the opening section of a lesson.  sure, i may have remembered the brief sentence from the opening lesson, but that doesn't mean i really understand the grammar rules or even understand what is being said.  the rather repetitive near verbatim followup lessons make the lessons boring at times insofar as that one is merely reviewing existing material without learning anything new.

while i think that the product clearly has some value for the cost of the product i am a bit disappointed.  i could see this as more of benefit towards students as a supplement to more traditional foreign language instruction, but i could hardly recommend this as a replacement for traditional language instruction.",2,software,base upon market rosetta stone would think software really novel far superior language learn method time software sure software start user present various picture software speak word phrase practice particular unit point even grammar session concept even basic word order ever even present basically presume one go learn trial error give enough time work without basic understand grammar one mindlessly repeat phrase one discovers pattern exactly efficient mean learn obviously * * way people learn l1 language ie first language mother tongue etc l2 language learn sometimes helpful case grammar language one learn substantially different one native language direct instruction grammar sense without know grammar really understand use language since mandarin chinese even general language group surprising grammar rule bite different english hence even little background might helpful criticism see obviously useful concept cardinal number get present early language course familiar concept get introduce fairly early one thing get bit monotonous much variety whereas voice far tell two female voice two male voice simply get shuffle around another criticism notice lack authentic text traditional course take foreign language always various authentic real world use language question eg newspaper advertisement cartoon etc use exercise despite cost program far tell rosetta stone bother license use actual authentic content obviously licensing content cost money seem exceedingly lazy even try spend time make content one learning language via immersion country say language primary language one obviously would obviously see language around various noncontrived us therefore rosetta stone boast immersion seem bit market hype opinion heck even seem teach anything culture absence understand bit culture one miss certain cultural reference phrase would useful conversation base upon sample phrase believe figure lot ironically find cheat look definition couple word can phrase helpful insofar guess wrong repeatedly context sentence marketing claim one build confidence use one vocabulary real situation see opportunity actually create one sentence software grade grammar anyone ever use grammar checker microsoft word similar application know design one perfect comprehension grammatical rule difficult expect software able grade mini essay language learning may bite tall order one area would find traditional classroom environment really get duplicate well software write section little pick 23 option make matter worse often time answer basically verbatim one see open section lesson sure may remember brief sentence open lesson mean really understand grammar rule even understand say rather repetitive near verbatim followup lesson make lesson bore time insofar one merely review exist material without learn anything new think product clearly value cost product bit disappointed could see benefit towards student supplement traditional foreign language instruction could hardly recommend replacement traditional language instruction

i have to disagree with that sentence... if you were just rating this on the game itself then sure.. it is the best fps warshooter out there, but... the reviews on amazon are here for the purpose of helping folks decide whether or not to purchase this product. now that activision has decided not to give folks the map pack token and charge more for the game of the year edition, when you can purchase the original cod4 for alot less and still save after downloading the map pack. so yes.. that alone drags your high rating down to at least 3 in my opinion. if you want to rate the game on its playability. go to one of those other game websites that rates the game on its own merits.

well, so far, it is absolutely wonderful for practicing writing the characters for my homework!  i enter in the pinyin and it prints a large display of the character, and you can set the animation timer to display the strokes in order.  that's really nice.

that's mostly what i've used it for so far, and that's well worth the price.  it's really neat too to hear the audio files, must be a lot of them.

so far the only real kicks i have are these:  i wish it was a little easier to use the tab button to get back to the box to enter more pinyin after the chinese character is displayed.  also, a couple of characters haven't been found in the program so far, but they were very simple ones, and i realize every single possible character couldn't be stored on the cd.

"scansoft has been nothing but difficult to deal with in resolving a problem that their own license management system created.

every few weeks the application manages to forget that it is not an evaluation copy and begins dysfunctionally labeling every page it generates with that annoying ""evaluation version"" diagonally laced across every page it produces.

i paid fully for my copy of this product and naively assumed that a call to customer support would resolve this issue.  it didn't.  instead, i was told that i'd have to call technical support (not an 800 number -- but not to worry, the ""first call"" is for no charge... oh yipee...)

note to all customer service departments:  never, ever, send a customer away with instructions to call someone else in your company instead.  make sure your customer service people can call and patch through customers on their own.  the only thing more annoying to a client than having to work through a phone menu system once to reach a flesh-and-blood person is having to do it twice with no guarantee of being closer to the solution than before.

so i called ""technical services.""  after answering enough questions to fill an autobiography from the person who picked up the line, it was suggested that i ""try"" reinstalling the software (as if i had nothing better to do with my time and as if i had not been through that exercise enough times before).  i suggested that whatever the solution to this issue was, it was definitely not that.  then the gentlemen indicated that he'd need a copy of the receipt (why did he not say so in the first place instead of suggesting i find yet more ways to waste my time?)

i suggested to him that he'd best put his supervisor on the line as he had a very angry customer on his hands.  after a prolonged period of being on hold, on my own long-distance dime, i hung up.

that friends, is scansoft's approach to customer relations.  they treat you like a questionably legitimate user by default and if their license management system screws up -- it must be (in their view) something you did.  nice, huh.

as for the product itself, it's okay.  i noticed that it seemed to have issues with some graphics, whereas the original version with some graphics would print crisply directly out of word, the pdf version was a bit jagged (even on the screen).

if scansoft had not wasted so much of my time with the license issue and completely lost my goodwill, i might have had more time to more seriously explore the product and say more.

the review below about the faulty design does echo a few things i noticed too.

suffice to say that i doubt that i'll ever be considering scansoft products in the future.  this experience has left a sufficiently bad taste in my mouth that i'll probably recommend my clients stay away from them too.

1) unlike almost every other software company on the planet, rs will not cut you a break on pricing for upgrades or enhancements.  for example, if you buy the v3 levels 1,2&3 and they later release levels 4 & 5, you are expected to pay full retail price instead of the difference of the cost from levels 1,2&3 to the level 1,2,3,4&5 pack.  to put this in real world terms: say you buy levels 1-3 for $550 today and 7 months from now rs releases levels 4&5.  you can either buy levels 1-5 for $700 (meaning you repurchase levels 1-3), or pay $420 for just levels 4&5.  this means, if you bought early in the product life cycle, your cost will be $970 for levels 1-5 as opposed to someone who waited for all five levels and only paid $700.  if they ever release levels 6-10, that means everyone who already bought the product pays more to complete the set than someone who waits.  (if they release a v4, you pay full retail again for the new version with no upgrade discount.)

2) rs' license agreement forbids resale of their software, so you're stuck with it.

now, here are the good things about it:

1) after taking french in college, i love that the product skips over all the drudgery and tedium of verb conjugation, vocabulary lists, etc!  you will learn actual uses of language in a natural way.  i found myself unconsciously formulating sentences in french after awhile.

2) when you start the program, there are numerous settings that control the focus on your efforts.  voice precision can be set from ""easy"" to ""difficult"", meaning you can either breeze through to get an idea of the language, move slowly to develop your pronunciation, or somewhere in between.  the lessons can also focus on reading/writing/listening/speaking, an extended version or read/writing or listening/speaking.

3) you will also learn practical expressions that likely won't be taught in classrooms.  it won't replace language practice with real human beings, but it gets you gets you moving in the direction of being able to speak with humans.

4) chances are you will find all those dry reference books on language a little more interesting as there's something real to relate.  one way to think of it is that rs plants the seed of a language in your head and it's up to you to keep developing it.

overall, i recommend the product to anyone who wants to learn a language and caution them to beware the price & company policies that come with it.",0,software,let start say rosetta stone great product get reason also thing know company policy great 1 unlike almost every software company planet r cut break pricing upgrades enhancement example buy v3 level 12 & 3 later release level 4 & 5 expected pay full retail price instead difference cost level 12 & 3 level 1234 & 5 pack put real world term say buy level 13 $ 550 today 7 month rs release level 4 & 5 either buy level 15 $ 700 mean repurchase level 13 pay $ 420 level 4 & 5 mean buy early product life cycle cost $ 970 level 15 oppose someone wait five level pay $ 700 ever release level 610 mean everyone already buy product pay complete set someone wait release v4 pay full retail new version upgrade discount 2 r license agreement forbids resale software stick good thing 1 take french college love product skip drudgery tedium verb conjugation vocabulary list etc learn actual us language natural way find unconsciously formulate sentence french awhile 2 start program numerous setting control focus effort voice precision set easy difficult mean either breeze get idea language move slowly develop pronunciation somewhere lesson also focus readingwritinglisteningspeaking extend version readwriting listeningspeaking 3 also learn practical expression likely taught classroom replace language practice real human being get get move direction able speak human 4 chance find dry reference book language little interesting something real relate one way think r plant seed language head keep develop overall recommend product anyone want learn language caution beware price & company policy come

"my husband and i just returned from a 10-day trip to mexico, and we barely even opened our phrasebook thanks to this wonderful software!

in the three months prior to the trip i did 45 lessons total from fluenz spanish 1 & 2 (i completed all of dvd 1 and half of dvd 2) on my macbook laptop, and my husband did about 6 lessons from dvd 1. once there, we were easily and confidently able to take taxis, order food and drinks at restaurants, make hotel reservations and check into hotels, go shopping, buy bus tickets and take intercity busses, and more--all practical topics which are thoroughly covered in the fluenz lessons.

what's more, i even had some actual conversations with locals, talking about who i am, what i do for work, a previous trip to mexico (past tense lessons came in handy, there!) and so forth. plus i read local newspapers, wrote postcards to spanish-speaking friends and understood a good portion of the movies that were playing with spanish dubbing on the intercity bus rides.

fluenz is a very sneaky piece of software--sometimes the lessons feel slow and basic, and you worry you're not learning fast enough. then you realize that you have actually internalized the vocabulary and structures so thoroughly that the words and phrases come naturally!

the format is excellent--instead of being stuck just doing writing or reading (as with books) or just with listening with no idea how words are spelled (as in pimsleur-type programs) or just with uncontextualized vocab (as in rosetta stone), you get it all--practice listening, understanding, pronouncing, reading, writing, plus indepth video explanations from the program's language tutor. plus, it's just plain fun to use (and the nice graphic design and modern look doesn't hurt, either).

nothing can substitute for a real-life class, but the tutor-driven format of fluenz is as close to a real-life class as it gets, and it has two big advantages over a class: first, price (since it's a dvd, both my husband and i could share it) and second, pacing/flexibility. on busy weeks i did only one or two lessons, but when i had more spare time (like when i was stuck home with a broken foot) i did a lesson each day. and i didn't have to worry about being at a class at a certain time each week.

i should note that we didn't use the fluenz dvds completely alone--i supplemented the lessons by watching favorite dvds with the spanish-language tracks turned on, by reading local new york city spanish-language newspapers and spanish-language children's books, and by doing some of the written exercises from the excellent book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/colloquial-spanish-of-latin-america-the-complete-course-for-beginners-colloquial-series-book-only/dp/0415237866/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8"">colloquial spanish of latin america: the complete course for beginners (colloquial series (book only))</a>. but i think that's a good idea with any language-learning program. and i definitely got my main base of understanding--and especially of pronouncing and speaking!--from the excellent lessons and practice i got with fluenz.

fluenz also has really excellent and fast customer service--one of my dvds didn't work right in my computer and they immediately sent a replacement.

my only suggestions to improvements in the software would be: 1. changing it so it's not tethered to the dvd itself (i just get nervous because dvds are so easily scratched and damaged), 2. adding a way to track progress or record progress and 3. adding more levels (like level 3).

"i am thrilled about the multi-user aspect of quickbooks for mac but am completely turned off by its glitchiness and instability. there are a multitude of issues with this software. i use it because we changed our office computers from pc's to mac. i usually love macs but this software makes my workday much more frustrating and is an overall pain in the rump. easily adds an hour and a half to two hours to my workday (when it's somewhat cooperating) trying to work through glitches. for example, i can usually enter about 4 sales receipts and by the time it's time to create the 5th sales receipt, it will not allow me to enter it. on average i have about 75 - 100 sales receipts/invoices to enter daily. stopping every 5 sales receipts/invoices to completely close out and restart the software because of glitches that won't allow me to either add the customer or their ordered items. the only way out of the cycle is to close it out and then restart. the time for it to connect and open the program is also very slow. i never had this type of problem with quickbooks for pc before. it is not only frustrating but makes me have to come in earlier to get work done for the same pay rate. if there is anything i can do to talk my bosses into going back to the pc version, i will do it; as the increase in work hours is not paid. if i cannot, i'm stuck with this unpredictable, unstable, and frustrating software. i know intuit is capable of much better than this! they have produced products i have come to trust and rely upon over the last 12 years.

if the intuit/quickbooks gods are listening, please spend money creating a good quality, usable quickbooks for mac with at least 50% less trouble than this version and i may want to buy/use it again : ) i hope future editions will work the kinks out but as for this one, it's chock full of 'em and has burned my hands, as a consumer. if you have no other choice and have to use this software, i feel sorry for you and i both. if you have other choices, do yourself the favor and dodge this bullet until intuit releases a decent version. if you have loads of extra time and want to spend it ""working"" with this program then this is the software for you.

update: july 12, 2011

i have contacted tech support and sent them a copy of my quickbooks file so the intuit techs could ""see exactly what's going on and fix it"" and guess what??? they couldn't even fix it. the problem persists! if my bosses were not such mac fans i would never use this version of quickbooks and i have become very vocal in discouraging folks from buying it. i wish someone had told me this product was this terribly flawed and unreliable. it has been and continues to be a nightmare with no sort of resolution in sight. what a sorry excuse for a product and tech support. i'm completely disgusted and feel duped by intuit. hope this product is soon off the market!

update: sept 14, 2011

still no support from tech support. last week, i actually scrapped this software and moved back to the pc version we had before. it is the only pc in the office and while that doesn't necessarily make my bosses happy, they came to understand how awful this software is to work with, or try to work with and are actively looking for an alternative to quickbooks for mac. had it been somewhat functional, my bosses were open to running it on vmware fusion as working with quickbooks on a pc is much more user friendly and reliable. i realize now, after several months of trying to resolve this issue and keep our day to day business transactions flowing that the folks over at quickbooks/intuit are money grubbing pigs who care nothing for their mac customers. they seem to be quite focused on pressuring you to purchase their monthly fee-based tech support. do not get the tech support package because they don't know how to fix their own software, let alone talk you through it over the phone. each rep i have dealt with has been very nice but terribly clueless about their product.  this was another expense while trying to get quickbooks for mac to work. the quickbooks specialist they sent could not even figure out how to fix it and suggested we scrap it and re-install again. we did, with the same results. even the specialist was frustrated by all the glitches. this product should not have been released while in the developmental stages. shame on you quickbooks!!! if you're listening quickbooks/intuit rep/troller for negative posts, you have lost a long time and loyal customer. i will absolutely be sure to discourage anyone and everyone i know and can think of from buying this problematic heap of glitches and bugs. i'd much rather hammer rusty nails under my fingernails than use the mac version of quickbooks again. since we got rid of it, it is a much happier work environment as we can all work a regular workday without the additional hours required to work with that awful software. tsk tsk tsk!",2,software,thrill multiuser aspect quickbooks mac completely turned glitchiness instability multitude issue software use change office computer pc mac usually love mac software make workday much frustrate overall pain rump easily add hour half two hour workday somewhat cooperate try work glitch example usually enter 4 sale receipt time time create 5th sale receipt allow enter average 75 100 sale receiptsinvoices enter daily stop every 5 sale receiptsinvoices completely close restart software glitch allow either add customer order item way cycle close restart time connect open program also slow never type problem quickbooks pc frustrating make come earlier get work do pay rate anything talk boss go back pc version increase work hour pay stuck unpredictable unstable frustrate software know intuit capable much well produce product come trust rely upon last 12 year intuitquickbooks god listen please spend money create good quality usable quickbooks mac least 50 % less trouble version may want buyuse hope future edition work kink one chock full em burn hand consumer choice use software feel sorry choice favor dodge bullet intuit release decent version load extra time want spend work program software update july 12 2011 contact tech support send copy quickbooks file intuit tech could see exactly go fix guess could even fix problem persist boss mac fan would never use version quickbooks become vocal discourage folk buy wish someone tell product terribly flaw unreliable continue nightmare sort resolution sight sorry excuse product tech support completely disgust feel dupe intuit hope product soon market update sept 14 2011 still support tech support last week actually scrap software move back pc version pc office necessarily make boss happy come understand awful software work try work actively look alternative quickbooks mac somewhat functional boss open run vmware fusion work quickbooks pc much user friendly reliable realize several month try resolve issue keep day day business transaction flow folk quickbooksintuit money grubbing pig care nothing mac customer seem quite focused pressure purchase monthly feebased tech support get tech support package know fix software let alone talk phone rep dealt nice terribly clueless product another expense try get quickbooks mac work quickbooks specialist sent could even figure fix suggest scrap reinstall result even specialist frustrated glitch product release developmental stage shame quickbooks listen quickbooksintuit reptroller negative post lose long time loyal customer absolutely sure discourage anyone everyone know think buy problematic heap glitch bug would much rather hammer rusty nail fingernail use mac version quickbooks since get rid much happy work environment work regular workday without additional hour require work awful software tsk tsk tsk

"i've read many of the negative reviews for this game, and valid points were made. while i liked the environment designs, they were used far too repetitively.  it was also annoying that with few exceptions, you could not equip looted armor on your companions, a flaw of necessity given the varying body types of the companion characters. i was also annoyed that certain abilities like rally, and all of the cloaking talents only lasted a few seconds at a time, while other abilities like arrow of slaying were absent from this sequel. spells like glyph of repulsion and glyph of paralysis, used to great effect in the previous game, are useless in this game (they don't even cover an area the size of a doorway), and i'd like to see them restored to their former glory in future releases. i'd also like to see the reappearance of a spell like true seeing from the balder's gate days that can be used as some sort of counter to the devastating disappear/backstab maneuvers of the hunters and assassins. i remember dedicating many hard earned ability slots to my warrior character that were designed to shrug off backstab damage, only to be continuously annihilated by these enemies. i also experienced many game crashes on my pc before i found a work around. anyone experiencing this problem simply has to go from the start screen into configure, then select the video tab, then uncheck the play in fullscreen box, then click the renderer tab and switch from directx11 to directx9. this game is also ridiculously easy on normal mode, so anyone who was bored with it needs to play through on nightmare, which is significantly more challenging, even more so then dao,  and requires the use of very creative tactics to get through. while many of the creatures and monsters in this game are grotesque and ridiculous looking (shades, abominations, flesh golems) others, like the revamped qunari, were iconic. it was also disappointing to see so many of the mages i felt compelled to defend resort to the very demonic methods they were accused of practicing in the first place.
  having said all of this, dragon age 2 does in some ways eclipse it's classic predecessor. powerful spell combinations are replaced with the synergistic use of abilities from all three character classes: mage rogue and warrior.  this allows for a wider variety of tactics. i also liked the fact that my main character now has a voice. graphics have also in some respects been updated and improved, and player and non player characters look very impressive and formidable executing certain combat abilities. on my second playthrough, i remembered to import my previously saved game from dao, and this lead to my player character having to face the consequences of many of the seemingly insignificant but ultimately far reaching decisions made while playing the first release.
  i am a huge fan of claudia black and simon templeman, and it was disappointing, but understandable that their talents were not lent to this latest release. while not quite as impressive, the voice over acting for this game is still exceptional, and some of the characters were very memorable in the case of varic, and adorable in the case of merrill.  the romance between lady hawke and merrill was very endearing, and i remember feeling real anxiety over the possibility that things would end badly for this elven mage.
  after playing through the game on nightmare mode, i probably won't play it again, but only because i'm exhausted, having prevailed over many hour long battles by the skin of my teeth.
it was however, a very compelling game that i willingly put the rest of my life on hold to complete.  if bioware releases a dragon age 3, i will rush out to buy it, without waiting for reviews.  i hope the creators will take the mixed reviews and use it as inspiration to create an even better game, as i would be tremendously disappointed if they decided not to release another game under this title.",0,game,read many negative review game valid point make liked environment design use far repetitively also annoy exception could equip looted armor companion flaw necessity give vary body type companion character also annoy certain ability like rally cloak talent last second time ability like arrow slay absent sequel spell like glyph repulsion glyph paralysis use great effect previous game useless game even cover area size doorway would like see restored former glory future release would also like see reappearance spell like true see balder gate day use sort counter devastate disappearbackstab maneuver hunter assassin remember dedicate many hard earn ability slot warrior character design shrug backstab damage continuously annihilated enemy also experience many game crash pc find work around anyone experience problem simply go start screen configure select video tab uncheck play fullscreen box click render tab switch directx11 directx9 game also ridiculously easy normal mode anyone bore need play nightmare significantly challenge even dao require use creative tactic get many creature monster game grotesque ridiculous look shades abomination flesh golems other like revamp qunari iconic also disappoint see many mages felt compelled defend resort demonic method accuse practice first place say dragon age 2 way eclipse classic predecessor powerful spell combination replace synergistic use ability three character class mage rogue warrior allows wider variety tactic also like fact main character voice graphic also respect updated improve player non player character look impressive formidable execute certain combat ability second playthrough remember import previously save game dao lead player character face consequence many seemingly insignificant ultimately far reach decision make play first release huge fan claudia black simon templeman disappoint understandable talent lent late release quite impressive voice act game still exceptional character memorable case varic adorable case merrill romance lady hawk merrill endear remember feeling real anxiety possibility thing would end badly elven mage playing game nightmare mode probably play exhaust prevail many hour long battle skin teeth however compelling game willingly put rest life hold complete bioware release dragon age 3 rush buy without wait review hope creator take mixed review use inspiration create even well game would tremendously disappointed decide release another game title

"i was looking for a navigation package to use in our motorhome. since size wasn't a factor and i had recently purchased a new laptop, i decided on a gps usb plug-in dongle paired with ms streets and trips 2009.

overall i'm less than impressed with microsoft's foray into mapping software. much like their personal finance software (ms money), i fear they've gotten into this branch of the business for competitive reasons vice a real desire to be the best. i've got two car-based gps systems in other vehicles, and they are much better optimized for the in-motion navigation mission.

the gui used in ms s&t 2009 takes a while to master (i'm a long way from 'master' status after a month). changing the default route (if you know another route is superior) is a bit clunky, and the mapping of roads is a bit sparse in rural areas. i've gotten the ""encountered an error and must close"" message several times while underway. a re-boot of the program usually solves the issue, but i've not had such an issue - ever - with my auto-based units.

overall, this product is inferior to google earth for stationary mapping, and inferior to just about any preloaded auto-based gps system for navigation purposes. since one can do both on one platform, however, i'd rate it overall as ""fair"".",1,software,look navigation package use motorhome since size factor recently purchase new laptop decide gps usb plugin dongle pair ms street trip 2009 overall less impressed microsoft foray mapping software much like personal finance software m money fear get branch business competitive reason vice real desire best get two carbased gps system vehicle much well optimized inmotion navigation mission gui use m & 2009 take master long way amaster status month change default route know another route superior bit clunky mapping road bite sparse rural area get encountered error must close message several time underway reboot program usually solve issue issue ever autobased unit overall product inferior google earth stationary mapping inferior preloaded autobased gps system navigation purpose since one one platform however would rate overall fair

"this game has stood out as receiving mixed reviews, both on the high end and low end of the spectrum. adding more fuel to the fire, the studio that developed the game was shut down by rockstar shortly after the games release. while the game might not have lived up to rockstar's, and many gamers expectations, it is a worthwhile adventure.

the game:
the game has a great story. it is structured around your character cole phelps (wwii veteran) turn cop in the late 40s. the missions in the game are called 'cases', each case varies in what has happened (murder, drug use, etc). for each case you investigate the crime scene and follow leads and ultimately it's up to you to choose the guilty person and charge them with the crime. some cases stand on their own while others tie together. you go through several positions within the police department: traffic, homicide, vice and arson. the cases are very interesting and they can be quite fun and intellectually stimulating as you work your way toward solving the case. while all this is going on there is a bigger story in the works, and you also see flashbacks of cole's wwii days. there are ""mini"" side-missions throughout the game which are activated by answering a call over the vehicles radio. the side-missions involve you chasing down a suspect, saving someone from threatening to jump off a building and so on.

while the cases are fun and intriguing with different scenarios, the process is the same. arrive at the scene, look for clues, talk to witnesses, drive around to locations of interest looking for other clues, chase down a suspect, get a confession and convict a suspect. all cases have the same process, so it gets boring over time. only toward the end of the game do you experience some big shoot-outs and different structured cases which are a nice change of pace, but some of these 'unique' cases should have been in place of some of the same static cases.

conclusion:
to sum it up. the game is good, i had fun playing la noire. there isn't much to do other than the cases and repetitive side missions. i got bored about 1/3 of the way through and took a few months off from playing the game, i then got back to it and got bored but pushed myself through to the end just to beat it and be done with it. the ending was lacking, as with many games these days, it felt rushed. the final action sequence is lacking emotion and suffers from bad editing, which is disappointing since the first half of the game was done so well. i assume it was pressure to finish the game on time that hurt the ending. either way la noire is a game that any avid gamer should experience, it is a very unique one-of-a-kind game. there is nothing else like la noire, but it may just be a bit too long and too static to become a aaa title.",1,game,game stand receive mixed review high end low end spectrum add fuel fire studio develop game shut rockstar shortly game release game might live rockstar many gamer expectation worthwhile adventure game game great story structure around character cole phelps wwii veteran turn cop late 40 mission game call case case varies happen murder drug use etc case investigate crime scene follow lead ultimately choose guilty person charge crime case stand other tie together go several position within police department traffic homicide vice arson case interest quite fun intellectually stimulating work way toward solve case go big story work also see flashback cole wwii day mini sidemissions throughout game activate answer call vehicle radio sidemissions involve chase suspect save someone threaten jump building case fun intrigue different scenario process arrive scene look clue talk witness drive around location interest look clue chase suspect get confession convict suspect case process get boring time toward end game experience big shootout different structured case nice change pace unique case place static case conclusion sum game good fun play la noire much case repetitive side mission get bored 13 way take month play game get back get bore pushed end beat do end lack many game day felt rushed final action sequence lack emotion suffers bad edit disappointing since first half game do well assume pressure finish game time hurt end either way la noire game avid gamer experience unique oneofakind game nothing els like la noire may bite long static become aaa title

"i've played all the halo's and have been a strong supporter of bungie since day one. but let's not get ourselves fooled here: this game is not for those that want a breathe taking single player campaign that will last them a life time. the first halo had a pretty solid single player campaign, and most people expected them to create some amazing campaigns in the following halos. this is the problem with peoples expectations. if you have not noticed the amount of people on xbox live, especially playing halo 3, you will notice that about 80% (roughly) of those who purchased halo 3 are playing it online one day or another. bungie did not want to pour their entire resources into the single player campaign simply because the target audience is those who wish to play online. however, the campaign becomes tenfold more enjoyable once you invite three of your friends into a co-op legendary game on live. tell me what fps allow you to play co-op single player campaign online with friends? tell me how many allow you to play with three friends?

with that said bungie has put out probably the best online fps on any console. yes resistances and pd0 have more players, but when it comes to variety, stability and overall fun halo 3 does not disappoint. the new weapons are a blast to play with, and overall the game is a lot more balanced then halo 2 was. halo 3 reigns supreme in multi player once again, and the statistics will show that for a long time to come.

a lot of people are also complaining about graphical polish. i think a lot of people tend to forget that halo 2 is backwards compatible and they need to compare the graphics between that and this. the graphics are greatly improved and are only topped on the 360 by gears of war.

the sound is perfect. the halo series always had a tight soundtrack and this is no exception. you will be seeking out the halo soundtrack to purchase once you hear the new tunes while chugging through the campaign. the marines also breath a lot of life into the game with the wonderfully sarcastic and humorous dialogue . hell even the grunts have a lot of new lines that will make you want to double take what you just heard.

there are also some new features in halo 3 that were not in the previous games. i will briefly detail those bellow.

in addition there is also the ability to ""forge"" maps, adding in new elements and making old maps fresh again with weapons, vehicles and even road blocks and the like. the forge is a unique tool that allows you to edit and re-create any map you wish. you can even dictate where players spawn!

another addition in halo 3 is the theater. you can record, take screenshots, or just watch your entire matchs over again. remember that night you killed twenty people in a row without dying? well, now you can relive that experience, record it, and share it with all your friends over xbox live. by having the ability to watch your matches you can seriously have your own version of ""halo tv"" and watch all the best matches, as well as find out your weakness and what you need to work on.

with all the great things in halo 3, there is need for a improvement. if theres one thing bungie should have addressed before releasing this game it would be the maps. while the multi player fps experience is the best out there, the maps do get a bit old. halo 2 combined with the multi player map pack has twice the maps halo 3 currently has. i'm sure bungie will address this down the road, but for now you will be mastering the maps in no time.

overall this is the best halo game to date. it's two key weak points are single player and lack of maps. one will be addressed with new maps, and the other will never be addressed. but who bought this game just to play the single player campaign? not many, and those who are looking forward to the single player campaign are better off renting it. for those who enjoy multi player, whether it's system link or over xbox live, the replay value is infinite and undoubtedly will suck up most of your time on the 360.",0,game,play halo strong supporter bungie since day one let get fooled game want breathe take single player campaign last life time first halo pretty solid single player campaign people expect create amazing campaign follow halo problem people expectation notice amount people xbox live especially play halo 3 notice 80 % roughly purchase halo 3 playing online one day another bungie want pour entire resource single player campaign simply target audience wish play online however campaign become tenfold enjoyable invite three friend coop legendary game live tell fps allow play coop single player campaign online friend tell many allow play three friend say bungie put probably best online fps console yes resistance pd0 player come variety stability overall fun halo 3 disappoint new weapon blast play overall game lot balance halo 2 halo 3 reign supreme multi player statistic show long time come lot people also complain graphical polish think lot people tend forget halo 2 backwards compatible need compare graphic graphic greatly improve top 360 gear war sound perfect halo series always tight soundtrack exception seek halo soundtrack purchase hear new tune chug campaign marine also breath lot life game wonderfully sarcastic humorous dialogue hell even grunt lot new line make want double take heard also new feature halo 3 previous game briefly detail bellow addition also ability forge map add new element make old map fresh weapon vehicle even road block like forge unique tool allow edit recreate map wish even dictate player spawn another addition halo 3 theater record take screenshots watch entire match remember night kill twenty people row without die well relive experience record share friends xbox live ability watch match seriously version halo tv watch best match well find weakness need work great thing halo 3 need improvement theres one thing bungie address releasing game would map multi player fps experience best map get bit old halo 2 combine multi player map pack twice map halo 3 currently sure bungie address road master map time overall best halo game date two key weak point single player lack map one address new map never address bought game play single player campaign many look forward single player campaign well rent enjoy multi player whether system link xbox live replay value infinite undoubtedly suck time 360

"i purchased this hotas to replace my logitech extreme 3d pro. i was hoping for something to feel a little more immersed in my games. this product certainly did the trick. unfortunately, there are some problems that led me to return it.

the first thing i noticed when i removed it from the box is that it was very light, despite the description saying it has a ""weighted base for greater stability."" that's fine, as my old extreme 3d pro was also pretty light. unlike the extreme 3d pro though, this stick does not have a wide base to keep it stable and on the desk when making quick movements that reach the limits of its range of motion. when playing the stick and throttle would also slide around my desk a bit unless i pushed down toward the desk as i moved them.

the description also mentions being able to program the buttons. this may work for the ps3. i didn't find any use in swapping the button mappings, as i used it on a pc and set my controls in the games i played. i can't speak to that feature other than the buttons for this feature are out of the way (on the base of the stick) so you won't accidentally press them.

the movement of the stick is very consistent across all ranges, but there is a large dead zone in the center that cannot be reduced in the configuration. the dead zone for the z-axis is also very large. this results in it being very difficult to make minor adjustments to my flight path or tracking small and slow moving enemies. i should also mention now that there isn't special software for configuring this device. the only available tools are the built-in windows device configuration and game settings. this results in you being able to increase the dead zones, but not reduce them. a major issue i have with the stick is that the trigger feels like a two-stage trigger, but is in fact a single-stage. there is about 2mm of play in the trigger where the spring provides a bit of resistance, but you have to fully depress the trigger until it clicks to get it to register.

the stick has a knob under it to adjust the resistance. it works well enough, but no matter the setting the stick would creak during use.

the throttle has a very satisfying grip and layout of buttons. the analog slider switch (that is actually a rocker) feels amazing, and works very well. like the stick, though, there are more cons than pros. the throttle has a spot where it will click to center at 50%. reading the included manual it looks like it is intended to be used at the ""zero"" point and pushing the stick in either direction from there should give you either forward or reverse thrust. for me it just turned into a pain because i need the full range of motion in my games. the center point where it will click into place has a large dead zone around it making it impossible to get smooth changes of throttle through that band.

the buttons on the stick and throttle are very inconsistent in their feel. some are very clicky and have nice feedback while others are very softy and ""mushy."" i think this is intentional based on what buttons have which feel. a minor annoyance. there is also a lit home button on the base of the throttle. this doesn't seem to do anything on pc except change colors when you press it. windows doesn't even recognize it as a button.

overall i will be buying a more expensive model that will be of higher quality. the cheap feel and lack of buttons on the stick are a deal breaker.",1,game,purchase hotas replace logitech extreme 3d pro hop something feel little immersed game product certainly trick unfortunately problem lead return first thing notice remove box light despite description say weighted base great stability fine old extreme 3d pro also pretty light unlike extreme 3d pro though stick wide base keep stable desk make quick movement reach limit range motion playing stick throttle would also slide around desk bit unless push toward desk move description also mention able program button may work ps3 find use swap button mapping use pc set control game play speak feature button feature way base stick accidentally press movement stick consistent across range large dead zone center reduce configuration dead zone zaxis also large result difficult make minor adjustment flight path track small slow move enemy also mention special software configure device available tool builtin windows device configuration game setting result able increase dead zone reduce major issue stick trigger feel like twostage trigger fact singlestage 2mm play trigger spring provide bit resistance fully depress trigger click get register stick knob adjust resistance work well enough matter set stick would creak use throttle satisfy grip layout button analog slider switch actually rocker feel amaze works well like stick though con pros throttle spot click center 50 % reading include manual look like intend use zero point push stick either direction give either forward reverse thrust turn pain need full range motion game center point click place large dead zone around make impossible get smooth change throttle band button stick throttle inconsistent feel clicky nice feedback other softy mushy think intentional base button feel minor annoyance also light home button base throttle seem anything pc except change color press window even recognize button overall buying expensive model high quality cheap feel lack button stick deal breaker

"long time quicken user and a retired computer tech here.... same password issues as all the others. tried to keep my original passwords but the program refused to to do any downloads from my online accounts. the software kept indicating my intuit password was wrong, followed their path to change the password (twice) but still the same error. on a hunch, i deleted the program and did a reload using the options offered to link my data file and my vault passwords to the newest intuit password. that worked and i am up and running, as a plus now i don't have to enter a second password when opening the vault.

recommendation....  make all your quicken passwords the same as your intuit password.  if you do not want to do that, don'y buy this until this flaw is fixed.

ps nothing new of value in this 2015 version, i bought it because of the 3 year limit on on-line downloads with the 2012 version i have. a free credit score is available on-line, and the portfolio x-ray is available at morningstar.

also since quicken 2015 modifies your data file, a complete system backup will make going back to yesterday, and yesterdays passwords, a lot easier.

"ulead's photoimpact 8 continues the ulead tradition of cramming tons of useful features into a relatively inexpensive program.  the previous version of the product received top ratings from a number of leading sites such as cnet.  version 8, in my opinion, adds very few new features that would justify the upgrade for most people.  and unfortunately, the very strength of this program is also its achilles' heel.  since it packs in so many features (photo editing, vector graphics, 3d features, html page creation, etc.), it has become a huge install (over 500 mb if you install everything).  further, it is extremely slow to load at startup.  i have a 2.0 ghz pentium with 512 mb ram, and it can still take between 20 and 40 seconds to fully load the program.  many users have indicated problems with stability and program crashes, though i have not experienced this yet.  and many of the extra features such as the html page creation and the javascript rollovers are of questionable value for the following reasons:
1) they tend to create very basic output, as with the html page creation, and you can probably do better on your own or with any inexpensive web page tools.
2)  these extra functions sound good on paper, but in reality they only contribute to the huge installation size, the slow loading of the program, and the cluttering of the already overcrowded menus.
photoimpact 8 can be a great graphics program and an alternative to expensive options such as adobe photoshop.  in the low end of the price spectrum , your two best options are photoimpact and paint shop pro.  but paint shop pro, long the market leader in this price range, has regained the lead.  they have just come out with their version 8 beta, and it is truly an elegant program.  it is fast, a much smaller install, and limits itself to just being a great graphics editor (rather than trying to do everything like photoimpact).  ultimately it's hard to go wrong with either one, but i believe ulead has lost the lead, and paint shop pro has regained it.",1,software,ulead photoimpact 8 continue ulead tradition cram ton useful feature relatively inexpensive program previous version product receive top rating number lead site cnet version 8 opinion add new feature would justify upgrade people unfortunately strength program also achilles heel since pack many feature photo edit vector graphic 3d feature html page creation etc become huge install 500 mb install everything extremely slow load startup 20 ghz pentium 512 mb ram still take 20 40 second fully load program many user indicate problem stability program crash though experienced yet many extra feature html page creation javascript rollover questionable value follow reason 1 tend create basic output html page creation probably well inexpensive web page tool 2 extra function sound good paper reality contribute huge installation size slow load program cluttering already overcrowd menu photoimpact 8 great graphic program alternative expensive option adobe photoshop low end price spectrum two best option photoimpact paint shop pro paint shop pro long market leader price range regain lead come version 8 beta truly elegant program fast much small install limit great graphic editor rather try everything like photoimpact ultimately hard go wrong either one believe ulead lose lead paint shop pro regain

"this stretcher works wonderfully - i have used it now for about a year.

mostly, i use it on two vintage fedoras, a stetson and a pilgrim.  i live in portland, and use them for the rainy weather here.  when i get home at the end of the day, i put them in the stretcher and adjust it just beyond tight.  it keeps them perfect! i like the fact that it can be adjusted very precisely.

if you were not careful, you could overstretch your hats if you did not have a good ""feel"" for how much to tighten the central screw that stretches the hat, but you could probably avoid this by marking the screw with something at the right spot - tape or a permanent marker.

also, it's not going to tell you what size it's stretching the hat to, but i only use it to keep my hats from shrinking or re-stretching them a bit if they do.

finally, i like the fact that the mold is only about the height of the lower part of the crown of the hat- some hat stretchers that simulate a head are too tall, too round, and have changed the shaped of the hat being stretched to the rounded shape of the mold- which ultimately ruined the lines of the hat being stretched.  not with this one- i'm very happy with it.

"the decision for whether or not you want this software really breaks down to a couple of considerations.
-- are you very conversant with accounting? once installed, sage 50 complete immediately displays its serious accounting credentials in a setup wizard that asks questions you don't get from some competitors - for example, whether you want to post transactions in real time or in batches, and whether you prefer to use cash or accrual accounting.
-- do you have a lot of inventory to keep track of? the 2013 edition expands the inventory analysis capabilities of sage business intelligence, the tool that integrates with microsoft excel (2003 or later) to move data into spreadsheets for advanced forecasting and other tasks. this is good, and a major selling point, but not for every business.
-- do you have a separate payroll system or are you willing to pay each time the tax tables change? sage has made it more difficult to manage payroll without enrolling in one of its subscription-based payroll add-on services. previously, you could manually update tax tables and then run payroll calculations in the program. now, without a service, you must perform payroll calculations outside of the program and import the results - a time-consuming process, to say the least. the cheapest payroll service costs $270 for the 2013 fiscal year. this expense practically doubles the cost of the software.

even though i used peachtree software (now sage 50) for years before starting a smaller business and going with quickbooks, i think ""moving up"" to this software would be a big step backward for a smaller business like mine. and even though i am very conversant with business accounting, learning to use it in conjunction with this software is a big investment in time and i don't see the point for a small business. so big business, big inventory, big bucks, go for it. otherwise, read all about it before you buy, because it's not just software, it's a big commitment.",1,software,decision whether want software really breaks couple consideration conversant account instal sage 50 complete immediately display serious accounting credential setup wizard asks question get competitor example whether want post transaction real time batch whether prefer use cash accrual accounting lot inventory keep track 2013 edition expand inventory analysis capability sage business intelligence tool integrates microsoft excel 2003 late move data spreadsheet advance forecasting task good major selling point every business separate payroll system willing pay time tax table change sage make difficult manage payroll without enrol one subscriptionbased payroll addon service previously could manually update tax table run payroll calculation program without service must perform payroll calculation outside program import result timeconsuming process say least cheap payroll service cost $ 270 2013 fiscal year expense practically double cost software even though use peachtree software sage 50 year start small business go quickbooks think move software would big step backward small business like mine even though conversant business accounting learning use conjunction software big investment time see point small business big business big inventory big buck go otherwise read buy software big commitment

"after using the pinnacle studio 20 plus system for a few weeks now i found that it had a lot of really great qualities and a few that made using the sofware very difficult.  first of all it allows you to create a movie from multiple different videos and

pros:
-motion tracking - allows you to add a text or object/image and stay with the person you put it by.
-over 50 templates!
-transparency - you can make your video transition to another part of the video with one image fading out and the other fading in
-multi camera view - you can have up to 4 images on the screen at the same time. if you have a video from different angles at the same time this is pretty neat. i was able to do this for my sons birthday when he blew out the candle for his 2nd birthday.
-start out with the smartmovie - this will walk you through the process and it makes it a bit easier to get the feel for how things work in the pinnacle studio 20 plus software

cons:
-this software is not initiative and i found it very difficult to figure out what to do next or what i could actually do - i found out later about the smartmovie that will help you walk through.
-you have to pay to see their online training videos for their software - if you purchase this, please be aware of this beforehand.

i tried to use the software and got very frustrated and ended up walking away from it. after a few days i came back and tried again with a very open mind and ended up making a very cute video that everyone enjoyed. i was very disappointed in them charging to view their how to and basic videos on how to use their program.",1,software,use pinnacle studio 20 plus system week find lot really great quality make use sofware difficult first allow create movie multiple different video pro motion track allows add text objectimage stay person put 50 template transparency make video transition another part video one image fade fade multi camera view 4 image screen time video different angle time pretty neat able son birthday blow candle 2nd birthday start smartmovie walk process make bit easy get feel thing work pinnacle studio 20 plus software con software initiative find difficult figure next could actually find later smartmovie help walk pay see online training video software purchase please aware beforehand try use software get frustrate end walk away day come back try open mind end make cute video everyone enjoy disappointed charge view basic video use program

"i downloaded the dev preview for the original windows 8. i was excited, yet skeptical, at how this would change the windows os going forward. it seemed like a great idea for converging tablets and desktops and simplifying the whole experience. i used windows 8, then 8.1 for almost 2 years. i really really wanted to like it, and gave metro a good go. however, the idea to converge desktop and tablet, led to a huge disparity, rather than unity. rather than the differences of tablet and desktop being in hardware, the contrast now exists in the operating system. they did not solve the problem, but rather displaced it.

windows 8.2 may improve on the ideas, but until then, i've decided to abandon ship.

first of all, the metro interface(now called the modern ui), is based on conflicting design philosophies. on one hand, it claims to reduce clutter, and clean up the entire design. then, it tries to cram unneeded information in the icons, or ""tiles"". the idea seems to be a good one, have a bunch of icons that show you relevant information instead of a static graphic representing the app. but really, if i needed information about the weather, or news, or social news, i could easily seek it out. rather than anticipating the information i need or want, it just throws everything out there on the home screen. granted, this information can be disabled.

metro apps, i've tried windows 8 and 8.1 on several computers, some old, some newly built, and i can't for the life of me get good startup times. microsoft has stated that a guideline for marketplace apps is that they must start up in 2 seconds or less. every app that i've opened, including netflix and facebook, have taken longer than me just opening up the corresponding website in the browser. and often times, they just crash, returning me silently to the start screen. no word of what happened, ala ios.

after how long this os has been out, it's very damning to see how little the app store had to offer. including many poorly made apps, and apps that just tell you to use the website(hulu plus).

in the end, i ended up solely using the ""legacy"" desktop, and using the start screen as a huge app search, uninstalling every metro app.

it's no all about ""modern ui"" though! the desktop has received some much needed new features, but does not compare to what windows 7 has done. boot times and file transferring are  vastly improved from windows 7. windows 8.1 has better compatibility with ssd's and uefi motherboards than windows 7. and windows 8.1 comes with integrated antivirus protection. but, while the built in antivirus was once a viable alternative to premium antivirus software, it has since fallen behind, and no longer recommended. :< there's no denying that windows 8.1 is an improvement, it's a great and powerful os if you ignore the modern ui. however, many features are ones that no one asked for. leaving me to think that the desktop mode is going to slowly fade, being forcibly replaced by the very limited modern ui. windows 8.1 is not bad, nor is it very good. upgrade from windows 7 if only for the performance and desktop enhancements.",1,software,download dev preview original windows 8 excited yet skeptical would change window o go forward seem like great idea converge tablet desktops simplify whole experience use windows 8 81 almost 2 year really really want like give metro good go however idea converge desktop tablet lead huge disparity rather unity rather difference tablet desktop hardware contrast exist operate system solve problem rather displace window 82 may improve idea decide abandon ship first metro interfacenow call modern ui base conflict design philosophy one hand claim reduce clutter clean entire design try cram unneeded information icon tile idea seem good one bunch icon show relevant information instead static graphic represent app really need information weather news social news could easily seek rather anticipate information need want throw everything home screen grant information disable metro apps try windows 8 81 several computer old newly build life get good startup time microsoft state guideline marketplace apps must start 2 second less every app open include netflix facebook take longer open correspond website browser often time crash return silently start screen word happen ala io long os damn see little app store offer include many poorly make apps apps tell use websitehulu plus end end solely use legacy desktop use start screen huge app search uninstalling every metro app modern ui though desktop receive much need new feature compare windows 7 do boot time file transfer vastly improve windows 7 window 81 good compatibility ssd uefi motherboards windows 7 window 81 come integrate antivirus protection build antivirus viable alternative premium antivirus software since fall behind longer recommend frown_sad_andry_or_pouting deny window 81 improvement great powerful o ignore modern ui however many feature one one ask leave think desktop mode go slowly fade forcibly replace limited modern ui windows 81 bad good upgrade window 7 performance desktop enhancement

"quickbooks pro 2016 i used after the qb top end online version. to be honest, this product needs online and the simplicity of the online version. the online version needs the features of this product, as it is missing all the functionality of the desktop version. it is unfortunate that they dominate the market, because someone could do so much better in terms of quality (features, smoothness of functions) and price. the number of features in this product is its saving grace, in addition to not being a yearly price, but after so many years they practically force you to upgrade your desktop version anyways.

pros: functionality, features, more cost effective and features than online.

cons: still priced high, no online or mobile features, missing the smoothness of qb online, forces you to upgrade after so many years, apps that incorporate into qb are extra per month.

all in all one of the best out there and that is not saying much. this sector needs more big competition, there is a lot of accounting software on the market, but none of them are quite at the level of qb. more competition forces the companies to create better products at a better price. 3/5",1,software,quickbooks pro 2016 used qb top end online version honest product need online simplicity online version online version need feature product miss functionality desktop version unfortunate dominate market someone could much good term quality feature smoothness function price number feature product save grace addition yearly price many year practically force upgrade desktop version anyways pro functionality feature cost effective feature online con still price high online mobile feature miss smoothness qb online force upgrade many year apps incorporate qb extra per month one best say much sector need big competition lot account software market none quite level qb competition force company create good product well price 35

"pros:
-fun addictive play like the original.
-tons of equipment and upgrades when leveling up to 60.
-the auction house allows you to trade or sell equipment.
-interesting classes.
-decent story - that feels rushed towards the end.
-easy travel system in game.

cons:
-repetitive - (until you play you have no idea how much so).
-to get further in levels and gear - you will play the same story (on the same character) 4 times.
-to get good equipment - you will have to get to lvl 60 - then continue to play the same game to gain ""paragon"" levels - which boost your magic find by 3 perc per paragon level - hoping to get 500+ magic find to find upgrades.
-when you finally get the legendary ""legendarys"" - you will find they are anything but - so you will be farming for gold to buy upgrades from the auction house that can cost 50 million gold+ for a single item.
-elite monster packs (3 of them in a group) are to drop the best gear - and are almost frustratingly difficult on inferno (4th play level)and beyond - can we say ""wall, freeze, vortex mortar and poison cloud all simultaneously). they are more difficult than diablo / azmodan by far.  i'm not sure why the elite packs aren't in charge of hell  - they could easily take diablo out.

overall - fun game that trains you to keep playing to get better gear and upgrades while playing through the same story 4 times. when you get to the end - you just want to play more to get one more piece of gear - but the amount of time you have to put in to get an improvement is more and more. similar to wow  w/o the monthly fee.",2,game,pro fun addictive play like original ton equipment upgrade level 60 auction house allow trade sell equipment interesting class decent story feel rush towards end easy travel system game con repetitive play idea much get level gear play story character 4 time get good equipment get lvl 60 continue play game gain paragon level boost magic find 3 perc per paragon level hop get 500+ magic find find upgrades finally get legendary legendarys find anything farming gold buy upgrades auction house cost 50 million gold+ single item elite monster pack 3 group drop best gear almost frustratingly difficult inferno 4th play leveland beyond say wall freeze vortex mortar poison cloud simultaneously difficult diablo azmodan far sure elite pack charge hell could easily take diablo overall fun game train keep play get good gear upgrade play story 4 time get end want play get one piece gear amount time put get improvement similar wow wo monthly fee

"when i first saw this game i had the impression that i might actually like it considering first person shooters are some of my favorite games. i had bought halo originally and was unimpressed by it's clumsy controls, uninspiring architecture and repetitive gameplay. the aliens themselves looked like something out of a computer animated saturday morning cartoon. ok... so after i finish the game, i think wtf was this?i thought maybe people liked it because of it's multiplayer as i did when i played quake2... (how that is even imaginable without a mouse and keyboard is beyond me. once you get used to it it's very, very, hard to go back.)

although i didn't get a chance to really play halo multiplayer i figured i'd give it a try on halo2. so i got this game and realized, that this was pretty much a recycled version of the first game i bought. i had registered an account with xbox live since i had a few months free to try it out, met some of the fanboys who swear by fact that they think xbox live is a superior gaming experience to that of a pc... ok... i'm thinking hell, this better be good. i played for a while, it was interesting to say the least for a few hours, until you realize that the balance of the whole online gameplay is out of whack. some weapons are absurdly overpowered and others underpowered leaving mostly those with the baddest weapons to dominate most of the game. why is the rocket launcher's blast radius so high? why even bother moving out of the way if you see it coming straight at you. pretty much your dead, period. there is no dodge button, or a sprint button, why is there even a jump button? you jump like you're on the (...) moon and you walk like you are in quicksand. the gameplay is pretty much mostly the same online everytime: shoot, kill, die, repeat. if you fall off the side of a building you do not die. this is like fps for babies. even worse the analog sticks are very limited to just the auto aim so it makes trying to shoot multiple targets trivial, especially if there is someone directly behind you. there is very little tactics here since there is no --->health<--- in the maps. this has to be the most unbalanced online game i have ever played, yet this is a console game so i'm not really that surprised.

the presentation of this game is fantastic however which got me interested in the first place, mind the hype, however when that dies off after the first day or 2 i realized i have bought a hollow poorly designed game packaged in a intriguing looking package, like an animal right into a trap. $50+ down the drain.

i thought well.. maybe the game will get better and there will be new stuff but the worst part of all of this is that what i first thought was going to be free updates to the game, bungie plans to sell thier new multiplayer maps just to play them online. w-t-f? two words... rip off.

why would i pay extra money to play online multiplayer maps when i can download as many as i want on other online games for free or design my own stuff? that is the final nail in the coffin for me on my xbox, this game is already sold, so are all my xbox games all that is left is the xbox itself which i only keep because of ggxx and shenmue 2. i'm not wasting any more money on an outdated piece of crap like an xbox.",2,game,first saw game impression might actually like consider first person shooter favorite game buy halo originally unimpressed clumsy control uninspiring architecture repetitive gameplay alien look like something computer animate saturday morning cartoon ok finish game think wtf thisi think maybe people like multiplayer play quake2 even imaginable without mouse keyboard beyond get use hard go back although get chance really play halo multiplayer figure would give try halo2 get game realize pretty much recycle version first game buy registered account xbox live since month free try meet fanboys swear fact think xbox live superior game experience pc ok think hell well good played interest say least hour realize balance whole online gameplay whack weapon absurdly overpower other underpowered leave mostly baddest weapon dominate game rocket launcher blast radius high even bother move way see come straight pretty much dead period dodge button sprint button even jump button jump like moon walk like quicksand gameplay pretty much mostly online everytime shoot kill die repeat fall side building die like fps baby even bad analog stick limited auto aim make try shoot multiple target trivial especially someone directly behind little tactic since > health < map unbalance online game ever play yet console game really surprised presentation game fantastic however get interested first place mind hype however die first day 2 realize buy hollow poorly design game package intrigue look package like animal right trap $ 50+ drain think well maybe game get good new stuff bad part first think go free update game bungie plan sell thier new multiplayer map play online wtf two word rip would pay extra money play online multiplayer map download many want online game free design stuff final nail coffin xbox game already sell xbox game leave xbox keep ggxx shenmue 2 waste money outdated piece crap like xbox

"what board game could be more american classic than monopoly? and monopoly 3 brings it to your pc! no more playing alone as 3 different players for days and days (yes...i did this as a child, before the age of technology). there are cute graphics and animations, nice sound effects and voices (albeit a bit repetitious after hours of play), options galore that allow you to play with all sorts of different rules and with the monopoly city versions of 10 cities (where the street names are names of places in that city etc). basically if you loved monopoly you will find this a good replacement to whining on your friends to play with you. but it does only seem to appeal to lovers of the game. not to mention that there are issues with the game ""cheating"", and doesn't allow for different levels of difficulty. i believe the patch sorts some of these issues out, and they are eliminated completely when you play over the net. that's the real fun - playing with other monopoly fanatics ;).

final fantasy xi features an amazing job system that allows you to select a character (hume, elvaan, tarutaru, or galka) and a job class for that character (warrior, monk, white mage, black mage...etc.).  it is at this point that you enter the world of vana'diel, full of thousands upon thousands of people playing worldwide, conversing, helping, and battling together.  unlike many mmorpg's, final fantasy xi has a rather in-depth story line and plenty of sub-quests to partake in.  getting stuck on a mission?  ask anyone, someone will know how to help.  and there are plenty of people to ask.  before the playstaion 2 version of final fantasy xi was released, there were already 1 million-plus registered users playing on the pc; and as a first in mmorpg's, final fantasy xi is cross-platform compatible, so when in need of answers, you have a million people to ask a question.
all of this is accessed through the playonline viewer, a program created by square-enix for the purpose of accessing their online gaming world.  this service includes e-mail, chat rooms, and a buddy list, all accessed through your playstation 2.
included in this neat little package is the playstation 2 40 gigabyte hard-drive.  this nifty little tool opens many new doors for the popular system.  at the moment, the only game released that supports it is final fantasy xi, but in the next couple of months expect a surge of games that utilize the new hardware in some way.  this particular bundle comes with the final fantasy xi software already installed.  also a folder is included on the drive for storing your old-but-cherished save files, freeing up room for the rest of your gaming needs.
now, back to final fantasy xi for a breif second.
an mmorpg is a vast and complex world that constantly changes and grows at time goes on.  new people are being introduced to a game every day and because of that, servers constantly need to be maintained.  this is where the fee comes in.
final fantasy xi has a minimal monthly fee of $12.95, with the option of $1 extra for each extra character you would like registered and $1 extra to partake in the tetra master card game originally featured in final fantasy ix.
also, purchase includes a 30-day free trial.

"i've played this game before on an xbox, and it was pretty fun. but i played it on a low resolution tv and had trouble with the interrogations due to the poor quality. so i decided to try the pc version to see if a higher quality screen would affect how easy the interviews were.

i'll never find out though, because this game looks terrible. it's clearly not optimized for pc, as it is locked at 30fps, and stutters even at this low frame rate. and even when being rendered in 1440p, the game just does not look very good. for reference, i'm using a geforce 980ti in my system, so the hardware should support a good gaming experience.

overall i can't recommend getting this for any pc gamers. i would have given it one star, but because i actually enjoyed the game the first time i played it i had to give it two stars instead.",2,game,played game xbox pretty fun play low resolution tv trouble interrogation due poor quality decide try pc version see high quality screen would affect easy interview never find though game look terrible clearly optimized pc lock 30fps stutter even low frame rate even render 1440p game look good reference use geforce 980ti system hardware support good gaming experience overall recommend get pc gamer would give one star actually enjoy game first time play give two star instead

i used it quite a bit for the first few months when i got it, however, i stopped playing my ps4 for about a year. i had stored them away at that time and so when i started playing my ps4 again and using them, the microphone doesn't work unless you twist the plug in the controller to a very specific spot. i've all just given up on using the microphone and use it as headphones instead.

the microphone not working happened last year, i only just got around to writing this review now because i used the headset and forgot about the issues with it.

this is good software, although i don't think its ready for small business owners market yet, and it appears to respond faster than paperport 14, but there are features missing and some things are counterintuitive and nonfunctional. i am slow from disability, and  paperport 14 is easier to maneuver even though filecenter 8 professional appears to be a good product.

having spent 33 hours with this product and not having the patience anymore to spend my time with technical assistance or helping companies develop their product from using my feedback given to them when i choose to respond back, for software improvement and gaining nothing in return for my time spent providing vendors with useful information other than thankyou.

to the best of my circumstances, i will never purchase software again from amazon due to their refund policy. lucion technologies looks as though their software can get a percentage of paperports market share, but they will never get my business again with the relationship amazon refund policies enforce on endusers.",1,software,amazon customer many year grant visual disorder exercise caution purchase online apparently miss boat one amazon allow refund download software within 30 day window vendor really strange consider received refund digital good vendor experience user find incompatible system andor product function properly buy software ever amazon apparently miss notating refund policy amazon product good software although think ready small business owner market yet appear respond faster paperport 14 feature miss thing counterintuitive nonfunctional slow disability paperport 14 easy maneuver even though filecenter 8 professional appear good product spend 33 hour product patience anymore spend time technical assistance help company develop product use feedback give choose respond back software improvement gain nothing return time spend provide vendor useful information thankyou best circumstance never purchase software amazon due refund policy lucion technology look though software get percentage paperports market share never get business relationship amazon refund policy enforce endusers
"i ran this on my macbook and my sister's macbook for about 6 months and i was pulling my hair out trying to figure out why i couldn't get on facebook easily and why images wouldn't load via facebook or google images. there were so many issues i just couldn't figure out. it never dawned on me until tonight that it could be the intego software. after months of stress over this, contacting my internet service provider over this, and looking for solutions online, i was able to find my own solution. uninstalling the software removed all issues with connection to facebook and google images. the computer is running so much better without intego installed and i highly recommend against purchasing this software due to the fact that it blocks important websites. my sister will be so excited to find out that i have found a solution to the issue and i hope anybody who is in the same boat as i was just an hour ago listens to this message and understands why this has happened!

"i like the program overall, but there are a few things that could definitely be better considering the money you must pay for the software.  i bought levels 1,2, and 3.  problems i've found are:  (1) the cd's and program do not install in your computer, therefore you must work with a cd in a drive.  this means you have a constant ""whirring"" sound to accompany your learning.  gets annoying after a while. (2) you can't make archival copies of the originals to work from which means you run the risk of accidentally scratching your original cd (from constantly having to put the cd in and take it out of the drive each time you work the program).  scratch your original cd and you are out a lot of money!  (3) even with a fast computer, the program works quite slow due to being forced to work from the cd.  i found myself often waiting for the computer to read information from the cd before i could progress with the lessons.

i'm disappointed with being forced to work from the cd's to make the program function and especially the accidental risk of damaging the cd's and basically losing a costly investment.

surely in this day and age a prominent company such as rosetta stone could come up with a better operation for their software to be used than what they currently have for their customers.",1,software,like program overall thing could definitely better consider money must pay software buy level 12 3 problem find 1 cd program install computer therefore must work cd drive mean constant whir sound accompany learn get annoy 2 make archival copy originals work mean run risk accidentally scratch original cd constantly put cd take drive time work program scratch original cd lot money 3 even fast computer program work quite slow due force work cd find often wait computer read information cd could progress lesson disappointed force work cd make program function especially accidental risk damage cd basically lose costly investment surely day age prominent company rosetta stone could come good operation software use currently customer
"don't blame amazon when you receive a 32-bit only version of the upgrade. blame microsoft.

i ordered my copy of the vista home premium to ultimate anytime upgrade direct from microsoft, hoping to avoid this whole 32-bit only fiasco, despite the fact that shipping time from microsoft is two to four weeks.

the package did arrive a few days early, but guess what... microsoft sent me the 32-bit only version of the upgrade, and now they expect me to pay shipping on a copy of the 64-bit disc.

i patiently waited for upgrade to arrive, and this is what i get? how stupid is that? would it have been so hard to include both versions in the package?

thanks, microsoft. don't think for a second i going to easily fork over another $5.99 to ship what you should have sent me in the first place....

update: it took some time, but i finally got hold of a rep who could help me at 888.285.6272 (open 'til 7:00 pm pt weekdays). after explaining i ordered direct from ms to avoid the whole 32-bit issue problem, she put my order in for 64-bit, to be shipped at no additional cost to me. be prepared to listen to hold music for awhile, as the reps are busy with this issue alone.

btw, you must call for the 64-bit replacement. online alternate media ordering (url in your 32-bit dvd package) will most likely only give you the option of ordering 32-bit cds.

"great product, terrible price.  i think turbo tax's days will be numbered if they keep the price up there as there are more and more good alternatives.  each year i grit my teeth when i plunk down the $$$ for turbo tax, but at least the product works well.  several years ago buying turbo tax was a no-brainer for me, but now i re-evaluate each year whether to continue or not.

the interview-style input is good and i love the real-time update of the refund/taxes-due at the top of the screen.  this feature makes it easy to catch certain mistakes.  it seems though, that each year i have to answer more and more strange questions that don't apply to me.  i wish there was some way to knock these off as a group but i understand why they have to do it the way they do.

"windows 8 has two big things that got too many negative critics: the full screen apps, and the start menu. i'm a power user and for me at the very beginning the charms bar, the new start menu seemed unusual. because we were using the windows xp style start menu since 2001. once i customized the menu for my needs it's very usable. you don't need mouse to use the start menu at all, everything is laid out for you nicely. the full screen makes it easier to find something. i actually never look for things in the start menu, just hit windows key and start typing the programs name. if it's a control panel item or file, type the name and hit tab select control panel, hit enter. this navigation is very fast and very easy to follow. it just takes 10 minutes to get used to, which is something you should do.

for the full screen apps: if you have a tablet, they're great, for non touch screen pcs, they're ok at best. but an extra feature that i don't really use or like doesn't make the rest of the operating system bad. just don't use them if you don't like them, all of those functionality is available somewhere else (weather app: a web site, bing news: again, a web site etc).

the overall stability of the os is like a service pack upgrade to windows 7, even early rtm of the product didn't have any stability issues (when compared to previous rtm major releases).

plus -- the dictionary function is a very nice feature to have (although some of the definitions provided for certain words are hilariously strange and obtuse).

this cd-rom game offers up good graphics, background options, and sound effects as well.

on a bit of a negative note, i feel that ""maven"" has a distinct advantage over the average scrabble participant, in that maven always knows those big, long, oddball-type words that you and i would never even consider plopping down. but, even so, it's fun when you can beat maven, especially when your computerized opponent is set at a ""high skill"" level.

so, if you enjoy playing word games on your computer, ""scrabble 2"" is a very good choice for sure.

"the first one i received had to be returned.  when connected, keyboard would light/flash spectrum colors, but no ability to type in windows.  cue software installation only showed demos, and warnings about no devices detected, or to connect a device.  looking for guidance in the support page for this keyboard at corsair, had very limited help in the q/a and didn't have anything specific to this model, however within the comments/help blogs i did find others who had experienced problems with this keyboard, and i tried all those steps to fix this problem myself to no avail.  i eventually talked to a support specialist at corsair.  he was very courteous and helpful, but after i explained all the steps i had taken to rectify this keyboard not being recognized with two other computers, he suggested returning it to amazon.  some remorse on my part for not reading deeper into the other reviews regarding issues being experienced by others before purchasing this particular keyboard.  this is not my first mechanical keyboard, but my first ""gaming"" one. i didn't realize that the upper case keys that are activated by the shift key are actually on the bottom of the keys and not on the top.  it's taken some time to remember that for keys that require the ""shift"" key to activate the ""upper"" case characters to display, that the labeling on the keys are opposite for punctuation(on the bottom of the key, not the top).  the keyboard is not ""silent"" and there is some clicking noise pushing the keys with sufficient pressure to activate the key.  i think claiming the keys are silent or quiet has a lot of room for interpretation, and can be a bit misleading.  one should be aware that regular typing on this keyboard will let others in the room know your typing away. for me, it's taking some time to learn to use the cue software, but i've got the keyboard lighting the way i want, and it's great for use in a subdued lighting environment. i like typing on this, i like the feel of the mechanical switch, just not crazy about the level of noise.  i'm otherwise a big supporter of ""corsair"" products in general and recently purchased the graphite series 780t case(5 stars), and h115i liquid cpu cooler(5 stars) for my build. like others who have commented about this keyboard, i think corsair needs to take another look at the hardware/software, and the q/a sections of the help file.  the upper and lower keys on the keyboard are the opposite of any other computer keyboard i've ever used.  if i had bothered to look at the item closer i would not have purchased this keyboard.",2,game,first one receive return connect keyboard would lightflash spectrum color ability type windows cue software installation show demos warning device detect connect device look guidance support page keyboard corsair limit help qa anything specific model however within commentshelp blog find other experience problem keyboard tried step fix problem avail eventually talk support specialist corsair courteous helpful explain step take rectify keyboard recognize two computer suggest return amazon remorse part read deep review regard issue experience other purchase particular keyboard first mechanical keyboard first game one realize upper case key activate shift key actually bottom key top take time remember key require shift key activate upper case character display label key opposite punctuationon bottom key top keyboard silent click noise push key sufficient pressure activate key think claim key silent quiet lot room interpretation bit mislead one aware regular type keyboard let other room know type away take time learn use cue software get keyboard light way want great use subdue light environment like type like feel mechanical switch crazy level noise otherwise big supporter corsair product general recently purchase graphite series 780t case5 star h115i liquid cpu cooler5 star build like other comment keyboard think corsair need take another look hardwaresoftware qa section help file upper low key keyboard opposite computer keyboard ever use bother look item closer would purchase keyboard

"i've read through a number of the comments, both ragingly negative and some that are positive. after dealing with windows 8 for yet another day, i can only say that i despise it. the interface is clownish at best, and incredibly frustrating. i have to admit that as much as i have come to loath windows 8 so quickly, that is in part to the ridiculous ""apps"" that run on it as well, which naturally are windows 8 compliant. navigation can be incredibly frustrating because things are hidden from the user. the comments that were made elsewhere about how frustrating the navigation is are spot on. this is a bad mashup between istuff and previous windows interfaces.

as an aside, i've been a user of various computer interfaces for some time. this is the first time that i've ever been this frustrated because a system was so counter-intuitive. it was not designed for those of us who have been windows users since day 1, nor was it designed for those of us who understand the mac interface. heck, i'm even fine with command line interfaces, which work fine. this is just a mess. at some point i'll learn how to navigate it, but microsoft is busy alienating users with this one. good luck to anybody who has to learn it quickly.

i gave windows 8 two stars because as an os, it does seem to do some of the important stuff, like boot and shut down quickly. it also seems very stable. in short, it's probably a pretty good os. it's just the gawd-awful interface that makes it such a miserable experience.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

some thoughts on version 8.1

here i am after using the os for some time. i still generally dislike the windows 8 interface. the fact that i had to edit the registry to get it to behave speaks much about the thought process that went into it. windows 8.1 was a huge improvement. it really did make the interface more usable, and enabled the average user to make it behave they way they wanted it without having to hack the registry. i'm still not wild about it, but 8.1 really did make a big difference. i've updated my original rating to 3 stars simply because of the overall improvements.",1,software,read number comment ragingly negative positive deal window 8 yet another day say despise interface clownish best incredibly frustrate admit much come loath windows 8 quickly part ridiculous apps run well naturally windows 8 compliant navigation incredibly frustrating thing hide user comment make elsewhere frustrating navigation spot bad mashup istuff previous window interface aside user various computer interface time first time ever frustrate system counterintuitive design u windows user since day 1 design u understand mac interface heck even fine command line interface work fine mess point learn navigate microsoft busy alienate user one good luck anybody learn quickly give window 8 two star os seem important stuff like boot shut quickly also seem stable short probably pretty good o gawdawful interface make miserable experience ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ thought version 81 use os time still generally dislike window 8 interface fact edit registry get behave speaks much think process go windows 81 huge improvement really make interface usable enabled average user make behave way want without hack registry still wild 81 really make big difference update original rating 3 star simply overall improvement

"so far, this has worked out a bit better than the charger that came with the wii u. i'll get the one negative out of the way and mention that you'll need a separate attachment for wall outlet charging unlike if you were using the wii u's stock charger but that negative is quickly canceled out by the fact that this is a usb charger which is an option that the wii u's stock charger doesn't provide. beyond that, it's either longer than the stock charger or at least equal and in a better way too since it doesn't have a power brick attached to it.

i use my gamepad mostly lying in bed so i think a good bit of the reason the old charger crapped out was the fact that the power brick was right in the middle of the cord which means either: 1) to use the full length of the cord, you'll often have the brick slightly lifted off the ground and its weight tugging at the end of the plug that's plugged into your gamepad which can't be all that good for the port and likely was the reason the wire in my old charger split near the end of the plug 2) you really only have like 5 feet of cord if you want the brick to remain on the ground at all times.

other pluses are that the cord is a good bit thicker than the stock charger's which seems like it'll make it more durable in the long run. i can't speak conclusively on that yet though since i'm only three months in with the new charger and the old one lasted about a year and a half. it's also nearly as flexible as the wiry thin cord of the stock charger so you get a pretty good tradeoff when comparing the combined sturdiness/flexibility of the two head to head and it's dirt cheap at the $8 i got it for.",0,game,far worked bit well charger come wii u get one negative way mention need separate attachment wall outlet charge unlike use wii u stock charger negative quickly cancel fact usb charger option wii u stock charger provide beyond either long stock charger least equal good way since power brick attach use gamepad mostly lie bed think good bit reason old charger crap fact power brick right middle cord mean either 1 use full length cord often brick slightly lift ground weight tug end plug plug gamepad good port likely reason wire old charger split near end plug 2 really like 5 foot cord want brick remain ground time pluses cord good bit thicker stock charger seem like make durable long run speak conclusively yet though since three month new charger old one last year half also nearly flexible wiry thin cord stock charger get pretty good tradeoff compare combine sturdinessflexibility two head head dirt cheap $ 8 get

"welllll.....

let's just say i own both xbox one and ps4 and i finally got time over the last two days to hook up my xbox (never owned an xbox before).  the setup was a bit of a hassle because since it is a ""media"" device and you can hook your tv stuff into it, it's a lot more complicated out of the box setup than the ps4.  i put it all together, put my dishnetwork hdmi into it and went through the tutorial.  off the bat, didn't work with my tv remote, off the bat didn't work with my dish setup.  got frustrated and turned it off.  a day later i attempted it again, this time i managed to get both working and i actually got it to switch channels, once........maybe it is a dish network dvr problem, maybe it is an xbox programming problem... i dunno, but one of the major features they tout and it doesn't work that well.  i go online and it seems i'm not the only one having this problem and there doesn't seem to be a solution yet.  one person says disabling the voice commands for kinect fixes the problem with working with the dvr for dish.... but doesn't that defeat the entire purpose of this system?

that being said, games are nice on it... i picked up dead rising 3 and have messed around a bit and it is an adequate gaming system, can i say it is better than the ps4?  well honestly i can't say because on ps4 i got marvel lego and injustice ultimate.  games not even related graphics wise and i barely use my ps4 because all the games i do want come out in 2014.  at least the xbox has ryse and dead rising... i'll have to pickup ryse very soon.

overall i give it 3 stars for now because the tv features aren't working properly... they get it fixed and it will be great.  i didn't have any drive issues luckly and my ps4 didn't have the blue light problem, so i'm double lucky on both systems.

the voice commands do work very nicely within the system itself and navigation... i do find the ui to be a confusing horrible mess, i suppose i need to just get used to it.

"disclaimer: i didn't play the full game in normal mode. i couldn't bear it. after an hour i turned on all weapons. another hour and i turned on god mode. later i just turned on noclip and wandered through the game. i imagine some people are going to fault me for not playing the real game experience. my point is that i'm faulting id for making me not want to. if a game can't hold my attention enough for me not to do this then its not a good game. if i hadn't been able to do this i wouldn't have bothered finishing. half-life, far cry, splinter cell, gta, these are all games that made gameplay interesting enough that i didn't feel like ""enough already, take me to the end"".

 if what you want in a game is basically doom with shiny surfaces, then you're fine. if you want something new, or even something with a refreshing twist, then aside from the rendering engine you're basically out of luck.

 the game is well produced. the voice acting is good. the facial animation is decent. the textures are all very detailed, but you know, the 'fun' bottleneck is no longer in the graphics. its in the gameplay.

 so the big news is the latest rendering engine from id, the people who brought us the first widely released fps. well, i'm sorry to say that from what i've seen the rendering engine is about on par with the source (half life 2), crytek (far cry) and unreal 3 (upcoming america's army and unreal releases) engines. there are probably purists out there that will say i'm insane for this and that doom 3 does x that none of those others do, or do as well. well, if i don't notice it when i'm playing it doesn't really matter does it? the most impressive things i saw were the distortions glass caused in anything beyond the glass, and the 'heat distortion' you could see in items that were extremely hot. the glass distortion was interesting for about 5 seconds the first time i saw it, and then distracting the rest of the time. the heat haze was interesting in one level, and almost completely obscured with smoke effects the rest of the time. yes, the lighting was very nice, but since its mostly used to create vast areas of darkness to 'freak you out', i began to hate the lighting.

 gameplay was tedious. if you're a huge fan of haunted houses, maybe this will appeal. if you're not, this is just going to drive home why you typically don't see haunted houses year round. it seems like every corridor is filled with false panels. it also seems like hell's minions have absolutely nothing better to do than to go wait behind one of those panels, wait for you to walk past and then pop out behind you. this kind of mechanism should be used at most once or twice in a game. here it shows up every 5 minutes or so.

 level design is repetitive. carmack talks about how many levels use up to half a gig of textures. yet the game comes on 3 cds. well the easy explanation for this is that the game has about 4 levels. it has the mars base level repeated ad naseum, the underground caverns level (seen for about 2 levels), hell (seen in one level and basically the end game) and mars base being overrun by hell (1 level) which really isn't original at all but uses a mixture of textures and design from previous levels. all in all, there are maybe 2 really 'wow' moments when you're looking around you. this isn't bad, except that the rest of the time, for me anyway, it wasn't so much a lack of 'wow' but a 'oh god not this again' feeling.

 overall this is the problem. the game wants to freak you out. and not just a couple of really good scares, but rather it wants you constantly edgy and terrefied. this isn't really what i want in a game, or at least not what i want the entire game to be about. think about the most suspenseful movie you've ever watched. now think about the most suspensful 5 minutes of that movie. now watch that 5 minutes over and over again. either you're going to get bored or you're going to need medication.

"once upon a time wow was a great game to play.  then blizzard ruined the game with a single innovation, arena play.  the biggest complaint with the battlegrounds prior to arena was losing pvp reputation if you didn't constantly run battlegrounds.  even if you constantly ran battlegrounds, you could lose pvp reputation because you didn't run them enough.  but at least the battleground scenarios were within the context of the game's lore.  then came arena where players could pvp either one on one or in groups of up to five.  arena had nothing to do with the game's internal lore.  this should have been a warning to blizzard that innovations outside of a game's lore is never a good idea.  as a result began the nerf-cycle.

1.  ""wah wah, (class here) is over powered and can't be beat in the arena!  wah wah!""
2.  blizzard nerfs (class here)
3.  pick a different player class
4.  go to step 1

eventually the uniqueness of the various classes became bland mediocrities and the content of the game was dumbed down compensate for the over-nerfing of character's abilities.

3) you can't build a city where you aren't always in the red and only staying above water due to income from exports. taxes should cover city expenses (fire, police, education, health etc) not exports.

"paperport is a product which has definitely gone downhill over the years, and paperport 14 is about as bad as it gets!
i have only been using v. 14 for little over a week now, and it has crashed at least 12 times over that period. compared to paperport v. 7, it is much slower, buggier, and harder to use.

also, instead of using a built in document viewer, as the older versions of paperport did, it uses an external program (pdf viewer plus) to view the pdf documents that paperport generates. the older versions had a built-in multi page document viewer, which performed much better from a workflow standpoint.

then there is the difficult and lengthy product registration process, which wasted 15 minutes of my time, and is unnecessarily complex.

the worst part is that paperport 14 crashes regularly, and for unknown reasons. i bought this product to use with windows 7 (32 bit professional version), since the older versions of paperport do not work with windows 7. the only thing that works reliably in this software package is the .max to pdf file conversion software that comes bundled with paperport 14, which allows you to convert your old  *.max format files to pdf format. since the ""new"" paperport stopped using the old .max format, you will need to use the bundled conversion software on your old scanned documents, if you plan to view or edit your old paperport documents with another brand of software (which i intend to do).

it is really a shame to see a product that i have used for over a decade deteriorate in the way that paperport has. they have made a formerly great product virtually unusable, which is a real shame.

"office 2008 is much what it is advertised to be: it is fast, flashy, and overflowing with ways to get your work done. from installation (which is more like a windows installation) you can pick and choose which products to install - i don't use entourage, so this review ignores that product - it was very simple to exclude from the installation.
it's hard to escape ms office these days, and though apple pages can save documents in office readable formats it is a process at every save that you must go through - this isn't a pages review, but i have used the apple productivity suites, and i must say i prefer office 2008 and not just for compatibility issues.
don't be fooled, there are some problems with office 2008 - the graphics are very nice and there are numerous views to organize and create word documents in - the cost is that these graphics do not always work correctly. problems occur especially when multiple windows are open, and office reacts strangely to osx spaces - the main word window will shift spaces when cycling through programs, and the toolbox has a strange way of dispersing itself across the spaces - press f8 to bring up all open spaces and you can quickly locate the fragments of the toolbox and by dragging them, reassemble it - a simple fix that can become time consuming (say if you like using the internet and itunes in different spaces) and it's something that shouldn't have to be fixed in the first place. in word the cursor has a way of disappearing after switching spaces and if it becomes visible again, well lucky you.
despite these flaws there have been some significant improvements. these are of course similar to those witnessed in office 2007 for pcs - bright graphics which replicate the menus of yesterday for doing such things as changing the style of your paper, adding word art, charts or virtually anything else you may want to do. these are again replicated in the toolbox - giving users at least three ways of accomplishing the same tasks (menus remain largely intact).
these changes make for a more customizable workspace, and much quicker access to various different functions of office 2008's various programs. things that even an experienced user may have once passed over are obvious and easily inserted quickly and without fuss (hyperlinks in power point are extremely easy, and provide thumbnails of slides for easily linking slides together). it doesn't just look good, it truly is useful - what really is simply a cosmetic change, is surprisingly helpful.

so - in conclusion office 2008 works faster, is reliable (never had a crash, always opened documents, works great with other versions of the programs - older versions still open and edit 2008 saved documents), is visually appealing and quickly provides its entire expansive list of features for users. unfortunately it is completely ignorant of spaces, and as such may become more of a headache than a blessing for anyone that uses spaces (pretty much at all - changing spaces leads to erratic behavior - writing this review i changed a song in itunes and literally lost the word window!).
i would recommend buying office 2008 - it has a lot of features, it is easy to use and can create some very nice looking documents and presentations. if the spaces get annoying, and you don't use or need all of the features then try apple's pages and front page - it has a lot to offer, but not quite as many features.",0,software,office 2008 much advertise fast flashy overflow way get work do installation like window installation pick choose product install use entourage review ignores product simple exclude installation hard escape m office day though apple page save document office readable format process every save must go page review use apple productivity suit must say prefer office 2008 compatibility issue fool problem office 2008 graphic nice numerous view organize create word document cost graphic always work correctly problem occur especially multiple window open office react strangely osx space main word window shift space cycle program toolbox strange way disperse across space press f8 bring open space quickly locate fragment toolbox drag reassemble simple fix become time consume say like use internet itunes different space something fix first place word cursor way disappear switch space becomes visible well lucky despite flaws significant improvement course similar witness office 2007 pc bright graphic replicate menu yesterday thing change style paper add word art chart virtually anything els may want replicate toolbox give user least three way accomplish task menu remain largely intact change make customizable workspace much quick access various different function office 2008 various program thing even experience user may pass obvious easily insert quickly without fuss hyperlink power point extremely easy provide thumbnail slide easily link slide together look good truly useful really simply cosmetic change surprisingly helpful conclusion office 2008 work faster reliable never crash always open document work great version program older version still open edit 2008 save document visually appeal quickly provide entire expansive list feature user unfortunately completely ignorant space may become headache bless anyone use space pretty much change space lead erratic behavior write review change song itunes literally lose word window would recommend buying office 2008 lot feature easy use create nice look document presentation space get annoy use need feature try apple page front page lot offer quite many feature

"i haven't played this but i don't think i really need to. with the lack of most basic rpg elements (leveling up, and the adventure portion of the genre, random occurences and optional game/story changing scenarios, ect ect) i feel like this game is more of an arcade 3rd person shooter game in a way, than an actual rpg adventure game. and after much reading of this game and watching videos and what not, i have came to a conclusion of not buying this game. not because i think the game sucks, i think its a great game (if it was wasn't called final fantasy that is), but because if i don't support this game they will bring back the rpg elements of the game for the next installment of the ff series, which i have grown to love, and trust me i grew up on the ff series. i started playing videogames since i was 4 years old (1989) and i am a zelda/metroid/ff fanatic. not all will agree with me, but a lot will and i am just expressing my opinion. i think linear games have died in the early-to-mid 90s. the only other ff game i remember being linear was 'final fantasy mystic quest' the 1st ff for the snes, and that did not have good reviews......it was also the first (and only) ff where you could actually make your characters jump at any time lol

ff12 battle was great, i found it easy to use the gambits, but others might not be so smart to use them to their advantage. the story was also compelling, i found it to be better than ffx and ffxiii, it had a ""lord of the rings"" adventure feel to it. and the world of ivalice was easy on the eyes even though it has dated graphics.

anyway, in conclusion i rate this a 3 because purely because of its graphics, it lost 1 star with the bland story and 1 star (should have been 2 star reduction but ill be nice) for deleting every basic rpg element!!!!

i know my 3-year-old niece will really love this umbrella, so i will keep returning it until i get one that is not torn.

"well, this year, after reading all the negative comments (well deserved, in my opinion) about the turbo tax managment's handling of their ""upgrades"",  i decided to forget about turbo tax, and i bought  the h&r block program instead.

now my return is fairly simple,  retirement income--social security and income from our ira accounts--no rental propteties, nothing special.  the
""deluxe"" turbo tax that was offered this year would have handled my needs, just as it had since 2007.  but i tought turbo tax needed to lose some skin.

didn't turn out that way.  was a glitch in the h&r block program that double counted my withheld tax, and no matter how i tried, could not
get it corrected.  so, i wrote off my sunk cost of some $40 in h&r block, and bought the turbo tax deluxe.

worked just as it always had, no problems, logical queries, all the things i was used to in past years. filed my federal taxes electronically,
mailed in the state return as always, and got my small refund from irs in less than ten days.

i think that turbo tax management might have listened to some dummy mba who convinced them to further segment their market, and capitalize
on upselling.  from what i read, they have incurred a lot of pain from it, and hopefully the people involved in the changes, and the poor communications of the changes  have been given the opportunity to place their next employer in deep jeopardy.

"i've been using the streets & trips package for a while, and was excited to see that 2004 had finally come out. i decided to go ahead and try it out and see what was wonderfully new and improved. so i went though the install process, and launched it for the first time with anticipation...
my thoughts chronologically: ""hmm, new spash screen.. yay, i'm in. ok.. whats new? um.. (click click click) where's the new stuff? i wonder if there is a versions.txt...nope. maybe they fixed that one route bug.... (crash) nope. argh! wait, is this 2004? maybe something happened, and it left 2003 on my system... lets see..

i was so depressed to see so little changes. they didn't incorporate any kind of new support for waypoint files like gpx like i was hoping they would, they didn't fix the bugs i was hoping for... in fact, i'm still not positive they made any changes except for the spash screen.

"civilization was tons of fun.  civilization ii made some notable improvements to combat, but added a great many units, city improvements, and government types.  the greater complexity burdened the game and the attempt at 3d perspective resulted in ugliness.  civiliation iii tweaks some details and added one huge innovation.  the most annoying of the tweaks is that the ""phalanx"" has become the ""spearman"" and the ""legion"" has become the ""swordsman."" come on, people!

the big innovation is ""culture.""  if you played alpha centauri, you noticed political borders.  one's cultural border is one's political border in civ iii.  certain improvements produce  a certain number of culture points per turn.  when the city produces a certain number of cumulative points, the cultural border of that city will expand, which may expand one's political border.  in rare circumnstaces, one civilization will engulf a neighbor's city.

espionage is so expensive in civ iii as to be rarely worthwhile.  the spaceship takes longer to build but, as soon as it's launched, the game is over.  one does not win for reaching alpha centauri, but rather for just launching the ship.

bombardment totally changes combat after gunpowder.  ships, aircraft, and artillery units may bombard a neighboring square.

the greatest virtue of civ i was the simple yet realistic design, which did not depend on graphics or burden the processor.  civs ii and iii added complexity but did not improve the game overall.  it seems the game is simply beyond meaningful improvement.  do not buy civ iii if you have one of the previous versions.  the graphics are better in the more recent version, but game play has undergone major changes--not always for the better.",1,game,civilization ton fun civilization ii make notable improvement combat add great many unit city improvement government type great complexity burden game attempt 3d perspective result ugliness civiliation iii tweak detail add one huge innovation annoy tweak phalanx become spearman legion become swordsman come people big innovation culture play alpha centauri notice political border one cultural border one political border civ iii certain improvement produce certain number culture point per turn city produce certain number cumulative point cultural border city expand may expand one political border rare circumnstaces one civilization engulf neighbor city espionage expensive civ iii rarely worthwhile spaceship take long build soon launched game one win reach alpha centauri rather launch ship bombardment totally change combat gunpowder ship aircraft artillery unit may bombard neighbor square great virtue civ simple yet realistic design depend graphic burden processor civs ii iii add complexity improve game overall seem game simply beyond meaningful improvement buy civ iii one previous version graphic well recent version game play undergone major changesnot always well

"adobe premiere elements is a stripped-down version of adobe's very professional video editing software. i bought this because i was fed up with other video editing software on my macbook pro. i still burn dvds of my video projects and appreciate that feature in adobe's product.

first off, adobe premiere elements, like all video editing, is a memory hog, so you must have a quick processor, an adequate video card, and plenty of memory to make the app run efficiently. i run 8 gb of memory which seems to be adequate.

likes:
the interface is fairly intuitive. there are several themes that you can download to create menus for dvds and bluray. it will correctly compress videos to fit on disc. it exports clips and movies in a wide variety of formats. it's easy enough for quick editing projects. it is more robust than imovie.

dislikes:
this still runs slowly, even with the 8 gb of memory. it tends to crash occasionally, so it may not be 100% compatible with mac os 10.9. processing large videos take a lot of time. admittedly, it takes a lot of time for any video editing software, especially on a laptop. burning dvds can take an extraordinarily long time. i use disc images to make duplicates, instead of using adobe premier.

the reason i give this app five stars is that it really is the better video editing software that i've used, compared with six others, including imovie.",0,software,adobe premiere element strippeddown version adobe professional video edit software buy fed video edit software macbook pro still burn dvds video project appreciate feature adobe product first adobe premiere element like video edit memory hog must quick processor adequate video card plenty memory make app run efficiently run 8 gb memory seem adequate like interface fairly intuitive several theme download create menu dvds bluray correctly compress video fit disc export clip movie wide variety format easy enough quick edit project robust imovie dislike still run slowly even 8 gb memory tend crash occasionally may 100 % compatible mac os 109 process large video take lot time admittedly take lot time video edit software especially laptop burning dvd take extraordinarily long time use disc image make duplicate instead use adobe premier reason give app five star really well video edit software use compare six other include imovie

"to start off i thought that this game would be awesome as most games by rockstar live up to that level of greatness.  however, i was extremely disappointed in this one.  my issues are not with the graphics or loading or anything with the actual look of the game, those areas were great.  this game is slow.  very slow.  you will spend around 80% of your time riding to and from locations.  if this game said that it is a horse riding game with some small other side quests it would be more accurate than a western cowboy type game.  however, even with excessive horse riding to get anywhere i loved the firefights and the shoot outs.
the reason i gave this game one star is the story line.  it is flat out awful.  the main protagonist is a jerk.  he starts a jerk and the ending is the worst written ending for a game i have ever played.  this is worse than any ending in a video game that i have ever played.  it made the entire experience not worth it.  i was down right angry at the ending.  all the work and effort you put into the game to make your character better and improve the world displayed in the map is a waste of time.  terrible script writing and definitely not worth a second play through.  one of the worst games i've ever played.  don't waste your time on this one.",2,game,start think game would awesome game rockstar live level greatness however extremely disappointed one issue graphic load anything actual look game area great game slow slow spend around 80 % time rid location game say horse rid game small side quest would accurate western cowboy type game however even excessive horse rid get anywhere love firefights shoot outs reason give game one star story line flat awful main protagonist jerk start jerk end bad write end game ever play bad end video game ever play make entire experience worth right angry end work effort put game make character well improve world displayed map waste time terrible script write definitely worth second play one bad game ever play waste time one
