"This machine comes with everything you need. Already half assembled, if you have never assembled one before, it will take you about 1 to 2 hours. If you have experience, it will take about 30 to 45 minutes. Cuts great. I didn't use candle software that comes with the machine, but the Universal G code sender I already had installed on the computer worked great. ( FYI- I do have candle already installed on my computer and it also works great with candle.) Using machine to engrave electrical alarm panels. Does a great job for what I need.",machine come everything need already half assemble never assemble one take 1 2 hour experience take 30 45 minute cut great use candle software come machine universal g code sender already instal computer work great fyi candle already instal computer also work great candle use machine engrave electrical alarm panel great job need

"This is my second FoxAlien product. My 4040 is an awesome machine that I use for carving, I wanted a laser setup so I ordered the 40w setup and so I did not have to change out the spindle I purchased a Masuter Pro. The only issue was the control board had problems (would not home and was failing to position) So I contacted support and they did an excellent job of diagnosing the issue and sending me a replacement controller in a timely fashion. You know you have a good company when something goes wrong and the respond quickly with replacement part or answers to question. I will for sure continue to purchase products from FoxAlien",second foxalien product 4040 awesome machine use carve want laser setup order 40w setup change spindle purchase masuter pro issue control board problem would home fail position contact support excellent job diagnose issue send replacement controller timely fashion know good company something go wrong respond quickly replacement part answer question sure continue purchase product foxalien
"Beginners will find this machine to be quite frustrating. Everything from setting up the included software to figuring out feeds and speeds is a black box with little to no information to help. But if you can get past that and get cutting, this thing is a little miracle at this price. The ability to turn it into a 4080, or upgrade to a 300w spindle or a laser, or add an offline controller for just a small additional investment is one of the biggest selling points for this particular machine over others.",beginner find machine quite frustrating everything set include software figure feed speed black box little information help get past get cut thing little miracle price ability turn 4080 upgrade 300w spindle laser add offline controller small additional investment one big sell point particular machine other
"Fox Alien definitely did there homework. This new machine is so awesome. Easy to assemble, set up, and run. The z axis is a huge upgrade previous the previous design.

"I've tried just about everything at this point changed belts, setup steps, and tightened every screw and bolts I could find and after ruining hundreds of dollars of stock. To this point after asking for help replacing the Controller Box I've heard nothing from support. I purchased the Masuter Pro and then the extension for the CNC which I'm into this CNC Machine way over $2,000.00 including stock purchased.

"Terrible product, the usb controller that you have to use gave someone access to my computer and they attempted to use my IP Address. Could never get it to communicate with my computer properly and there is absolutely zero technical support.

"This thing is garbage. The limit switches are junk and keep on sticking. They have messed up on me multiple times while cutting. The power cord fits so loose that vibration can cause it to come unplugged. The clamps are garbage, used 4 clamps and project still moved. After 5 failed attempts on the same projects, I unhooked it and put it in the closet till I find someone who wants to buy this P.O.S.

"Overall the machine works well, and the Axis move to how you position and without issues. However the spindle and the holder that it comes with do not and by this I mean the spindle isn't secure enough to not lower itself during the engraving. I've been trying to figure it out and then I noticed my spindle keep dropping without the z axis dropping. and on top of that I can't tighten or loosen the spindle holder because the screws have stripped. I'll have to figure out a work around but overall an adequate machine.",overall machine work well axis move position without issue however spindle holder come mean spindle secure enough low engrave try figure notice spindle keep drop without z axis drop top tighten loosen spindle holder screw strip figure work around overall adequate machine
"I recently bought the Longer RAY5 Laser Engraver, and it has exceeded my expectations in every way. The 5W output laser, combined with the 40W laser engraving cutter, makes it incredibly powerful and precise for a variety of material including wood and metal.

I love my Longer Ray 5 10w laser. It does better than I expected. I am new to the laser world and this laser is great for beginners and experienced laser crafters.

This is the best 10 watt laser output I've seen so far. The frame definitely needs some work as far as organizing wires. I installed my own track which was not too hard to do. But if you're looking just for quality to start with this unit is beautiful for that as you can see in my pictures. My unit is a 10 watt unit. I was very curious what a 20 watt unit can do.

"Hooray for Westinghouse. This power washer came well packed, all the right parts, they fit well, easy instructions — and it works like a charm. Good pressure for clearing off slippery mildew from my stone walkways. The wheels keep it stable so it doesn't tip over.

"This power washer is exactly what I was looking for to help clean around the house. I used it to clean the dust/dirt off my porch, deck, outdoor funnel and walls of my house and it worked beautifully. I was concerned about it having too much pressure and causing damage to my paint and concrete but it handled it perfectly with the 25 degree nozzle. Now I know if I need more pressure, I can go with a smaller nozzle. I'll be able to use it to clean my cars and bikes next.

"I bought this attachment to go along with a 2000psi electric pressure washer I have. I knew the pressure washer wasn't the strongest, so I didn't have the highest expect with how it would power the surface cleaner. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the cleaner worked great and was so much easier to use than just the regular wand. It still required me to go slow on the concrete (otherwise you could see some swirl marks where it didn't get completely clean) but overall it was much faster than using the wand. Wish I would have bought it sooner.",buy attachment go along 2000psi electric pressure washer knew pressure washer strong high expect would power surface cleaner pleasantly surprise see cleaner work great much easy use regular wand still require go slow concrete otherwise could see swirl mark get completely clean overall much faster use wand wish would buy sooner
This pressure washer looks nice and the build quality is adequate but the cleaning ability is poor. It blows off dust and light dirt but don't expect it to do much cleaning.

"Product is great for washing cars and some light cleaning of porches and driveways. However, I could not get it work with any of my outside outlets as they are all GFCI. After 10-20 seconds of working, it would trip my breakers. Tried all outlets. Ended up having to plug inside the house in a standard outlet with an extension cord, then worked as it should have.

The free shipping is great! These weigh a ton. It would have cost as much or more to ship these than what was paid to buy them. These are great moving skates but have the same issues as any others. You need to put a pad or something to keep your equipment from slipping off. Plus as the riggers told me never put them on 4 corners. Put 2 at the rear and a steerable one on the front to maneuver.

"We’ve been using this CNC machine in our workshop for about a year now, and it has been fantastic.

Maintenance has been minimal so far, which is a huge plus for us, as downtime can be costly. The machine’s build quality is solid, and it’s been a real asset to our production process.

While it’s accurate when it works, it constantly breaks down during heavy use. We’ve had to replace multiple parts already, and the machine requires constant maintenance just to keep it running.
